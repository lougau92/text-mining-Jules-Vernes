Three seconds before the arrival of J. B. Hobson’s [PERSON] letter, I no more thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the passage of the North Sea [PLACE]. Three seconds after reading the letter of the honourable Secretary of Marine [PERSON], I felt that my true vocation, the sole end of my life, was to chase this disturbing monster, and purge it from the world.

But I had just returned from a fatiguing journey, weary and longing for repose. I aspired to nothing more than again seeing my country, my friends, my little lodging by the Jardin des Plantes [PLACE], my dear and precious collections. But nothing could keep me back! I forgot all—fatigue, friends and collections—and accepted without hesitation the offer of the American Government.

“Besides,” thought I, “all roads lead back to Europe [PLACE] (for my particular benefit), and I will not hurry me towards the coast of France [PLACE]. This worthy animal may allow itself to be caught in the seas of Europe [PLACE] (for my particular benefit), and I will not bring back less than half a yard of his ivory halberd to the Museum of Natural History. But in the meanwhile I must seek this narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean [PLACE], which, to return to France [PLACE], was taking the road to the antipodes.

“Conseil [PERSON],” I called in an impatient voice.

Conseil [PERSON] was my servant, a true, devoted Flemish boy, who had accompanied me in all my travels. I liked him, and he returned the liking well. He was phlegmatic by nature, regular from principle, zealous from habit, evincing little disturbance at the different surprises of life, very quick with his hands, and apt at any service required of him; and, despite his name, never giving advice—even when asked for it.

Conseil [PERSON] had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led. Never once did he complain of the length or fatigue of a journey, never make an objection to pack his portmanteau for whatever country it might be, or however far away, whether China [PLACE] or Congo [PLACE]. Besides all this, he had good health, which defied all sickness, and solid muscles, but no nerves; good morals are understood. This boy was thirty years old, and his age to that of his master as fifteen to twenty. May I be excused for saying that I was forty years old?

But Conseil [PERSON] had one fault: he was ceremonious to a degree, and would never speak to me but in the third person, which was sometimes provoking.

“Conseil [PERSON],” said I again, beginning with feverish hands to make preparations for my departure.

We are not returning to Paris [PLACE], then?” said Conseil [PERSON].

“Oh! certainly,” I answered, evasively, “by making a curve.”

We take our passage in the Abraham Lincoln [PLACE].

“As you think proper, sir,” coolly replied Conseil [PERSON].

I opened a credit account for Babiroussa, and, Conseil [PERSON] following, I jumped into a cab. Our luggage was transported to the deck of the frigate immediately. I hastened on board and asked for Commander Farragut [PERSON]. One of the sailors conducted me to the poop, where I found myself in the presence of a good-looking officer, who held out his hand to me.

“Monsieur Pierre Aronnax [PERSON]?” said he.

“H

imself,” replied I; “Commander Farragut [PERSON]?”

The Abraham Lincoln [PLACE] had been well chosen and equipped for her new destination.

At that moment Commander Farragut [PERSON] was ordering the last moorings to be cast loose which held the Abraham Lincoln [PLACE] to the pier of Brooklyn [PLACE].

But Commander Farragut [PERSON] would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the seas in which the animal had been sighted. He sent for the engineer [PERSON].

“Is the steam full on?” asked he.

“Yes, sir,” replied the engineer [PERSON].

The quay of Brooklyn [PLACE], and all that part of New York [PLACE] bordering on the East River [PLACE], was crowded with spectators.

Then the frigate, following the coast of New Jersey [PLACE] along the right bank of the beautiful river, covered with villas, passed between the forts, which saluted her with their heaviest guns.

Then modifying its speed to take the narrow channel marked by buoys placed in the inner bay formed by Sandy Hook Point [PLACE], it coasted the long sandy beach, where some thousands of spectators gave it one final cheer.

The escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate, and did not leave her until they came abreast of the lightship, whose two lights marked the entrance of New York [PLACE] Channel.

Six bells struck, the pilot got into his boat, and rejoined the little schooner which was waiting under our lee, the fires were made up, the screw beat the waves more rapidly, the frigate skirted the low yellow coast of Long Island [PLACE]; and at eight bells, after having lost sight in the north-west of the lights of Fire Island [PLACE], she ran at full steam on to the dark waters of the Atlantic [PLACE].
