CHAPTER I A SHIFTING REEF 
 
The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of ['Europe and America', 'the two continents'], naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several states on ['Europe and America', 'the two continents'], were deeply interested in the matter. 
 
For some time past, vessels had been met by “an enormous thing,” a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. 
 
The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'], the untiring rapidity of ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'] movements, ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'] surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'] seemed endowed. If ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'] was a cetacean, ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'] surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times,—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'] a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'] down as a mile in width and three in length,—we might fairly conclude that ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'] surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the ichthyologists of the day, if ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'] existed at all. And that ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'] _did_ exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it']. As to ['classing', 'the idea'] ['the object or creature in question', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this object', 'it', 'this mysterious being', 'it', 'it', 'this supernatural apparition', 'it'] in the list of fables, ['classing', 'the idea'] was out of the question. 
 
On the 20th of July, 1866, ['the steamer _Governor Higginson_, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company', 'the _Governor Higginson_'], had met ['this moving mass', 'the inexplicable object'] five miles off the east coast of Australia. ['Captain Baker', 'he', 'he'] thought at first that ['Captain Baker', 'he', 'he'] was in the presence of ['an unknown sandbank', 'its', 'the sandbank']; ['Captain Baker', 'he', 'he'] even prepared to determine ['an unknown sandbank', 'its', 'the sandbank'] exact position, when two columns of water, projected by ['this moving mass', 'the inexplicable object'], shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless ['an unknown sandbank', 'its', 'the sandbank'] had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, ['the steamer _Governor Higginson_, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company', 'the _Governor Higginson_'] had to do neither more nor less than with ['an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-['an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour', 'its']es columns of water mixed with air and vapour', 'its']. 
 
Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the _Columbus_, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But ['this extraordinary cetaceous creature', 'itself', 'it'] could transport ['this extraordinary cetaceous creature', 'itself', 'it'] from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the _Governor Higginson_ and the _Columbus_ had observed ['this extraordinary cetaceous creature', 'itself', 'it'] at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues. 
 
Fifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, ['the _Helvetia_, of the Compagnie-Nati['the _Helvetia_, of the Compagnie-Nationale, and the _Shannon_, of the Royal Mail Steamship Company', 'they', 'themselves', 'the _Shannon_ and _Helvetia_', 'they'], sailing to windward in that portion of the Atlantic lying between the United States and Europe, respectively ['signalled', 'these simultaneous observations'] ['the _Helvetia_, of the Compagnie-Nationale', 'the monster', 'the mammal', 'it'] to each other in 42° 15′ N. lat. and 60° 35′ W. long. In ['signalled', 'these simultaneous observations'] ['the _Helvetia_, of the Compagnie-Nationale, and the _Shannon_, of the Royal Mail Steamship Company', 'they', 'themselves', 'the _Shannon_ and _Helvetia_', 'they'] thought ['the _Helvetia_, of the Compagnie-Nationale, and the _Shannon_, of the Royal Mail Steamship Company', 'they', 'themselves', 'the _Shannon_ and _Helvetia_', 'they'] justified in estimating the minimum length of ['the _Helvetia_, of the Compagnie-Nationale', 'the monster', 'the mammal', 'it'] at more than three hundred and fifty feet, as ['the _Helvetia_, of the Compagnie-Nationale, and the _Shannon_, of the Royal Mail Steamship Company', 'they', 'themselves', 'the _Shannon_ and _Helvetia_', 'they'] were of smaller dimensions than ['the _Helvetia_, of the Compagnie-Nationale', 'the monster', 'the mammal', 'it'], though ['the _Helvetia_, of the Compagnie-Nationale, and the _Shannon_, of the Royal Mail Steamship Company', 'they', 'themselves', 'the _Shannon_ and _Helvetia_', 'they'] measured three hundred feet over all. 
 
Now ['the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea round the Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands', 'they'], have never exceeded ['the length of sixty yards', 'that'], if ['the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea round the Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands', 'they'] attain ['the length of sixty yards', 'that']. 
 
These reports arriving one after the other, with fresh observations made on board the transatlantic ship _Pereire_, ['a collision which occurred between the _Etna_ of the Inman line and the monster', 'the phenomenon', 'the matter'], a _procès verbal_ directed by the officers of the French frigate _Normandie_, a very accurate survey made by the staff of Commodore Fitz-James on board the _Lord Clyde_, greatly influenced public opinion. Light-thinking people jested upon ['a collision which occurred between the _Etna_ of the Inman line and the monster', 'the phenomenon', 'the matter'], but grave practical countries, such as England, America, and Germany, treated ['a collision which occurred between the _Etna_ of the Inman line and the monster', 'the phenomenon', 'the matter'] more seriously. 
 
In every place of great resort ['the monster', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] was the fashion. They sang of ['the monster', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] in the cafés, ridiculed ['the monster', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] in ['the papers', 'the papers'], and represented ['the monster', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] on the stage. All kinds of stories were circulated regarding ['the monster', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it']. There appeared in ['the papers', 'the papers'] caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary creature, from the white whale, the terrible “Moby Dick” of hyperborean regions, to the immense kraken whose tentacles could entangle ['a ship of five hundred tons', 'it'], and hurry ['a ship of five hundred tons', 'it'] into the abyss of the ocean. The legends of ancient times were even resuscitated, and the opinions of Aristotle and Pliny revived, who admitted the existence of these monsters, as well as the Norwegian tales of Bishop Pontoppidan, the accounts of Paul Heggede, and, last of all, the reports of Mr. Harrington (whose good faith no one could suspect), who affirmed that, being on board the _Castillan_, in ['1857', 'that time'], he had seen this enormous serpent, which had never until ['1857', 'that time'] frequented any other seas but those of the ancient “_Constitutionnel_.” 
 
Then burst forth the interminable controversy between the credulous and the incredulous in the societies of savants and the scientific journals. “The question of the monster” inflamed all minds. ['Editors of scientific journals', 'they'], quarrelling with believers in the supernatural, spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign, some even drawing blood; for, from the sea-serpent ['Editors of scientific journals', 'they'] came to direct personalities. 
 
For six months war was waged with various fortune in the leading articles of the Geographical Institution of Brazil, the Royal Academy of Science of Berlin, the British Association, the Smithsonian Institution of Washington, in the discussions of the “Indian Archipelago,” of the Cosmos of the Abbé Moigno, in the Mittheilungen of Petermann, in the scientific chronicles of the great journals of France and other countries. The cheaper journals replied keenly and with inexhaustible zest. ['These satirical writers', 'their'] parodied a remark of Linnæus, quoted by the adversaries of the monster, maintaining “that nature did not make fools,” and adjured ['These satirical writers', 'their'] contemporaries not to give the lie to nature, by admitting the existence of krakens, sea-serpents, “Moby Dicks,” and other lucubrations of delirious sailors. At length an article in a well-known satirical journal by a favourite contributor, the chief of the staff, settled ['the monster', 'it'], like Hippolytus, giving ['the monster', 'it'] the death-blow amidst an universal burst of laughter. Wit had conquered science. 
 
During the first months of the year 1867 ['the question', 'It', 'The question'] seemed buried, never to revive, when new facts were brought before the public. ['the question', 'It', 'The question'] was then no longer a scientific problem to be solved, but a real danger seriously to be avoided. ['the question', 'It', 'The question'] took quite another shape. The monster became a small island, a rock, a reef, but a reef of indefinite and shifting proportions. 
 
On the 5th of March, 1867, ['the _Moravian_, of the Montreal Ocean Company', 'herself', 'her', 'it', 'the _Moravian_', 'she', 'she'], finding ['the _Moravian_, of the Montreal Ocean Company', 'herself', 'her', 'it', 'the _Moravian_', 'she', 'she'] during the night in 27° 30′ lat. and 72° 15′ long., struck on ['the _Moravian_, of the Montreal Ocean Company', 'herself', 'her', 'it', 'the _Moravian_', 'she', 'she'] starboard quarter a rock, marked in no chart for that part of the sea. Under the combined efforts of ['the wind', 'its'] and ['the wind', 'its'] four hundred horse-power, ['the _Moravian_, of the Montreal Ocean Company', 'herself', 'her', 'it', 'the _Moravian_', 'she', 'she'] was going at the rate of thirteen knots. Had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of ['the _Moravian_, of the Montreal Ocean Company', 'herself', 'her', 'it', 'the _Moravian_', 'she', 'she'], ['the _Moravian_, of the Montreal Ocean Company', 'herself', 'her', 'it', 'the _Moravian_', 'she', 'she'] would have been broken by the shock and gone down with the 237 passengers ['the _Moravian_, of the Montreal Ocean Company', 'herself', 'her', 'it', 'the _Moravian_', 'she', 'she'] was bringing home from Canada. 
 
The accident happened about five o’clock in the morning, as the day was breaking. ['The officers of the quarter-deck', 'They', 'They', 'they'] hurried to the after-part of ['the vessel', 'the _Moravian_', 'its', 'it', 'the ship’s', 'her']. ['The officers of the quarter-deck', 'They', 'They', 'they'] examined the sea with the most scrupulous attention. ['The officers of the quarter-deck', 'They', 'They', 'they'] saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables’ length distant, as if the surface had been violently agitated. The bearings of the place were taken exactly, and ['the vessel', 'the _Moravian_', 'its', 'it', 'the ship’s', 'her'] continued ['the vessel', 'the _Moravian_', 'its', 'it', 'the ship’s', 'her'] route without apparent damage. Had ['the vessel', 'the _Moravian_', 'its', 'it', 'the ship’s', 'her'] struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous wreck? ['The officers of the quarter-deck', 'They', 'They', 'they'] could not tell; but on examination of ['the vessel', 'the _Moravian_', 'its', 'it', 'the ship’s', 'her'] bottom when undergoing repairs, it was found that part of ['the vessel', 'the _Moravian_', 'its', 'it', 'the ship’s', 'her'] keel was broken. 
 
['This fact, so grave in itself', 'it'], might perhaps have been forgotten like many others if, three weeks after, ['This fact, so grave in itself', 'it'] had not been re-enacted under similar circumstances. But, thanks to the nationality of the victim of the shock, thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel belonged, the circumstance became extensively circulated. 
 
The 13th of April, 1867, the sea being beautiful, the breeze favourable, ['the _Scotia_, of the Cunard Company’s line', 'herself', 'She'], found ['the _Scotia_, of the Cunard Company’s line', 'herself', 'She'] in 15° 12′ long. and 45° 37′ lat. ['the _Scotia_, of the Cunard Company’s line', 'herself', 'She'] was going at the speed of thirteen knots and a half. 
 
At seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon, whilst the passengers were assembled at lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt on the hull of ['the _Scotia_', 'her'], on ['the _Scotia_', 'her'] quarter, a little aft of the port-paddle. 
 
['The _Scotia_', 'she', 'the ship’s', 'the _Scotia_', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'she'] had not struck, but ['The _Scotia_', 'she', 'the ship’s', 'the _Scotia_', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'she'] had been struck, and seemingly by something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt. The shock had been so slight that no one had been alarmed, had it not been for the shouts of the carpenter’s watch, who rushed on to the bridge, exclaiming, “['We', 'we'] are sinking! ['We', 'we'] are sinking!” At first ['the passengers', 'them'] were much frightened, but ['Captain Anderson', 'Captain Anderson', 'He', 'Captain Anderson'] hastened to reassure ['the passengers', 'them']. The danger could not be imminent. The _Scotia_, divided into seven compartments by strong partitions, could brave with impunity any leak. ['Captain Anderson', 'Captain Anderson', 'He', 'Captain Anderson'] went down immediately into the hold. ['Captain Anderson', 'Captain Anderson', 'He', 'Captain Anderson'] found that ['the sea', 'the water'] was pouring into ['the fifth compartment', 'this compartment']; and the rapidity of the influx proved that the force of ['the sea', 'the water'] was considerable. Fortunately ['the fifth compartment', 'this compartment'] did not hold the boilers, or the fires would have been immediately extinguished. ['Captain Anderson', 'Captain Anderson', 'He', 'Captain Anderson'] ordered the engines to be stopped at once, and one of ['the men', 'they'] went down to ascertain the extent of the injury. Some minutes afterwards ['the men', 'they'] discovered the existence of a large hole, of two yards in diameter, in ['The _Scotia_', 'she', 'the ship’s', 'the _Scotia_', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'she'] bottom. Such a leak could not be stopped; and ['The _Scotia_', 'she', 'the ship’s', 'the _Scotia_', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'she'], ['The _Scotia_', 'she', 'the ship’s', 'the _Scotia_', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'she'] paddles half submerged, was obliged to continue ['The _Scotia_', 'she', 'the ship’s', 'the _Scotia_', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'she'] course. ['The _Scotia_', 'she', 'the ship’s', 'the _Scotia_', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'she'] was then three hundred miles from Cape Clear, and after three days’ delay, which caused great uneasiness in Liverpool, ['The _Scotia_', 'she', 'the ship’s', 'the _Scotia_', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'she'] entered the basin of the company. 
 
['The engineers', 'They'] visited the _Scotia_, which was put in dry dock. ['The engineers', 'They'] could scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below water-mark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle. ['The broken place in the iron plates', 'it'] was so perfectly defined that ['The broken place in the iron plates', 'it'] could not have been more neatly done by a punch. It was clear, then, that ['the instrument producing the perforation', 'itself'] was not of a common stamp; and after having been driven with prodigious strength, and piercing an iron plate 1-3/8 inches thick, had withdrawn ['the instrument producing the perforation', 'itself'] by a retrograde motion truly inexplicable. 
 
Such was the last fact, which resulted in exciting once more the torrent of public opinion. From this moment all unlucky casualties which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to ['the monster', 'this imaginary creature']. Upon ['the monster', 'this imaginary creature'] rested the responsibility of all these shipwrecks, which unfortunately were considerable; for of three thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at Lloyd’s, the number of sailing and steam ships supposed to be totally lost, from the absence of all news, amounted to not less than two hundred! 
 
Now, it was ['the “monster”', 'this formidable cetacean'] who, justly or unjustly, was ['accused', 'it'] of their disappearance, and, thanks to ['accused', 'it'], communication between the different continents became more and more dangerous. The public demanded peremptorily that the seas should at any price be relieved from ['the “monster”', 'this formidable cetacean']. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER II PRO AND CON 
 
At the period when these events took place, ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] had just returned from ['a scientific research in the disagreeable territory of Nebraska, in the Unit['Nebraska, in the United States', 'Nebraska']. In virtue of ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] office as Assistant Professor in the Museum of Natural History in Paris, ['the French Government', 'France'] had attached ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] to ['a scientific research in the disagreeable territory of Nebraska, in the United States', 'that expedition']. After six months in ['Nebraska, in the United States', 'Nebraska'], ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] arrived in New York towards the end of March, laden with a precious collection. ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] departure for ['the French Government', 'France'] was fixed for the first days in May. Meanwhile, ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] was occupying ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] in classifying ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] mineralogical, botanical, and zoological riches, when the accident happened to the _Scotia_. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day. How could ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] be otherwise? ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] had read and re-read all the American and European papers without being any nearer a conclusion. This mystery puzzled ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I']. Under the impossibility of forming an opinion, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] jumped from one extreme to the other. That there really was something could not be doubted, and ['the incredulous', 'their'] were invited to put ['the incredulous', 'their'] finger on the wound of the _Scotia_. 
 
On my arrival at New York ['the question', 'its'] was at ['the question', 'its'] height. The hypothesis of ['the floating island', 'this shoal', 'its', 'it', 'its'], and the unapproachable sandbank, supported by minds little competent to form a judgment, was abandoned. And, indeed, unless ['the floating island', 'this shoal', 'its', 'it', 'its'] had a machine in ['the floating island', 'this shoal', 'its', 'it', 'its'] stomach, how could ['the floating island', 'this shoal', 'its', 'it', 'its'] change ['the floating island', 'this shoal', 'its', 'it', 'its'] position with such astonishing rapidity? 
 
From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck was given up. 
 
There remained then only two possible solutions of the question, which created two distinct parties: on one side, those who were for a monster of colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a submarine vessel of enormous motive power. 
 
But ['this last hypothesis', 'it'], plausible as ['this last hypothesis', 'it'] was, could not stand against inquiries made in both worlds. That ['a private gentleman', 'his'] should have ['such a machine', 'it', 'its'] at ['a private gentleman', 'his'] command was not likely. Where, when, and how was ['such a machine', 'it', 'its'] built? and how could ['such a machine', 'it', 'its'] construction have been kept secret? Certainly a Government might possess such a destructive machine. And in these disastrous times, when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the power of weapons of war, it was possible that, without the knowledge of others, a state might try to work such a formidable engine. After the chassepots came ['the torpedoes', 'the torpedoes'], after ['the torpedoes', 'the torpedoes'] the submarine rams, then—the reaction. At least, I hope so. 
 
But ['the hypothesis of a war machine', 'their'] fell before the declaration of Governments. As public interest was in question, and transatlantic communications suffered, ['the hypothesis of a war machine', 'their'] veracity could not be doubted. But, how admit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped the public eye? For a private gentleman to keep the secret under such circumstances would be very difficult, and for a state whose every act is persistently watched by powerful rivals, certainly impossible. 
 
After inquiries made in England, France, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Italy, and America, even in Turkey, the hypothesis of a submarine monitor was definitely rejected. 
 
Upon ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] arrival in New York several persons did ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] the honour of consulting ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] on ['the phenomenon in question', 'the question in all its forms', 'its']. ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] had published in France ['a work in quarto, in two volumes, entitled “Mysteries of the Great Submarine Grounds', 'This book, highly approved of in the learned world'].” ['a work in quarto, in two volumes, entitled “Mysteries of the Great Submarine Grounds', 'This book, highly approved of in the learned world'], gained for ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] a special reputation in this rather obscure branch of Natural History. ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] advice was asked. As long as ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could deny the reality of the fact, ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] confined ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] to a decided negative. But soon, finding ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] driven into a corner, ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was obliged to explain ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] categorically. And even “the Honourable Pierre Aronnax, Professor in the Museum of Paris,” was called upon by the _New York Herald_ to express a definite opinion of some sort. ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] did something. ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] spoke, for want of power to hold ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] tongue. ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] discussed ['the phenomenon in question', 'the question in all its forms['the phenomenon in question', 'the question in all its forms', 'its']'its'], politically and scientifically; and ['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] give here an extract from ['a carefully-studied article which I publis['my', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I']ed in the number of the 30th of April', 'It']. ['a carefully-studied article which I published in the number of the 30th of April', 'It'] ran as follows:— 
 
“After examining one by one the different hypotheses, rejecting all other suggestions, it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a marine animal of enormous power. 
 
“['The great depths of the ocean', 'them', 'those remote['the ocean', 'the ocean'] are entirely unknown to us. Soundings cannot reach ['The great depths of the ocean', 'them', 'those remote depths']. What passes in ['The great depths of the ocean', 'them', 'those remote depths']—what beings live, or can live, twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the waters—what is the organisation of these animals, we can scarcely conjecture. However, the solution of the problem submitted to me may modify the form of the dilemma. Either ['we', 'our', 'we', 'we'] do know ['all the varieties of beings which people our planet', '['we', 'our', 'we', 'we']m all'], or ['we', 'our', 'we', 'we'] do not. If ['we', 'our', 'we', 'we'] do _not_ know ['all the varieties of beings which people our planet', 'them all']—if Nature has still secrets in ichthyology for us, nothing is more conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes, or cetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organisation formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings, and which an accident of some sort, either fatastical or capricious, has brought at long intervals to the upper level of ['the ocean', 'the ocean']. 
 
“If, on the contrary, we _do_ know all living kinds, we must necessarily seek for the animal in question amongst those marine beings already classed; and, in that case, I should be disposed to admit the existence of a gigantic narwhal. 
 
“['The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the animal required', 'It'], often attains a length of sixty feet. Increase ['The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the animal required', 'It'] size fivefold or tenfold, give ['The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the animal required', 'It'] strength proportionate to ['The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the animal required', 'It'] size, lengthen ['The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the animal required', 'It'] destructive weapons, and you obtain ['The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the animal required', 'It']. ['The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the animal required', 'It'] will have the proportions determined by the officers of the _Shannon_, the instrument required by the perforation of the _Scotia_, and the power necessary to pierce the hull of the steamer. 
 
“Indeed, the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword, a halberd, according to the expression of certain naturalists. The principal tusk has the hardness of steel. Some of these tusks have been found buried in the bodies of whales, which the unicorn always attacks with success. ['Others', 'they'] have been drawn out, not without trouble, from the bottoms of ships, which ['Others', 'they'] had pierced through and through, as a gimlet pierces a barrel. The Museum of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris possesses one of these defensive weapons, two yards and a quarter in length, and fifteen inches in diameter at the base. 
 
“Very well! suppose ['this weapon', 'it'] to be six times stronger and ['the animal', 'it', 'it'] ten times more powerful; launch ['this weapon', 'it'] at the rate of twenty miles an hour, and you obtain a shock capable of producing the catastrophe required. Until further information, therefore, I shall maintain ['the animal', 'it', 'it'] to be a sea-unicorn of colossal dimensions, armed not with a halberd, but with a real spur, as the armoured frigates, or the ‘rams’ of war, whose massiveness and motive power ['the animal', 'it', 'it'] would possess at the same time. Thus may this puzzling phenomenon be explained, unless there be something over and above all that one has ever conjectured, seen, perceived, or experienced; which is just within the bounds of possibility.” 
 
These last words were cowardly on ['my', 'I', 'my'] part; but, up to a certain point, ['my', 'I', 'my'] wished to shelter ['my', 'I', 'my'] dignity as Professor, and not give too much cause for laughter to ['the Americans, who laugh well when they do la['the Americans, who laugh well when they do laugh', 'they'], 'they']. 
 
['I', 'myself', 'I', 'My'] reserved for ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'My'] a way of escape. In effect, however, ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'My'] admitted the existence of the “monster.” ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'My['My article', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'it'] was warmly discussed, which procured ['My article', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'it'] a high reputation. ['My article', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'it'] rallied round ['My article', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'it'] a certain number of partisans. The solution ['My article', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'it'] proposed gave, at least, full liberty to the imagination. The human mind delights in grand conceptions of ['supernatural beings', 'their', 'these giants']. And the sea is precisely ['supernatural beings', 'their', 'these giants'] best vehicle, the only medium through which ['supernatural beings', 'their', 'these giants'] (against which terrestrial animals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses, are as nothing) can be produced or developed. 
 
The industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from this point of view. The _Shipping and Mercantile Gazette_, the _Lloyd’s List_, the _Packet-Boat_, and the _Maritime and Colonial Review_, all papers devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their rates of premium, were unanimous on this point. Public opinion had been pronounced. ['The United States', 'they'] were the first in the field; and in New York ['The United States', 'they'] made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue ['this narwhal', 'the monster', 'the monster', 'it', 'it', 'this unicorn', 'it', 'It', 'this slender fly', 'its']. A frigate of great speed, the _Abraham Lincoln_, was put in commission as soon as possible. The arsenals were opened to ['Commander Farragut, who hastened the arming of his friga['Commander Farragut, who hastened the arming of his frigate', 'his'], 'his']; but, as it always happens, the moment it was decided to pursue ['this narwhal', 'the monster', 'the monster', 'it', 'it', 'this unicorn', 'it', 'It', 'this slender fly', 'its'], ['this narwhal', 'the monster', 'the monster', 'it', 'it', 'this unicorn', 'it', 'It', 'this slender fly', 'its'] did not appear. For two months no one heard ['this narwhal', 'the monster', 'the monster', 'it', 'it', 'this unicorn', 'it', 'It', 'this slender fly', 'its'] spoken of. No ship met with ['this narwhal', 'the monster', 'the monster', 'it', 'it', 'this unicorn', 'it', 'It', 'this slender fly', 'its']. It seemed as if ['this narwhal', 'the monster', 'the monster', 'it', 'it', 'this unicorn', 'it', 'It', 'this slender fly', 'its'] knew of the plots weaving around ['this narwhal', 'the monster', 'the monster', 'it', 'it', 'this unicorn', 'it', 'It', 'this slender fly', 'its']. ['this narwhal', 'the monster', 'the monster', 'it', 'it', 'this unicorn', 'it', 'It', 'this slender fly', 'its'] had been so much talked of, even through the Atlantic cable, that jesters pretended that ['this narwhal', 'the monster', 'the monster', 'it', 'it', 'this unicorn', 'it', 'It', 'this slender fly', 'its'] had stopped ['a telegram', 'it'] on ['this narwhal', 'the monster', 'the monster', 'it', 'it', 'this unicorn', 'it', 'It', 'this slender fly', 'its'] passage and was making the most of ['a telegram', 'it']. 
 
So when the frigate had been armed for a long campaign, and provided with formidable fishing apparatus, no one could tell what course to pursue. Impatience grew apace, when, on the 2nd of July, they learned that ['a steamer of the line of San Francisco, from California to Shanghai', 'The ship'], had ['seen', 'this news'] the animal three weeks before in the North Pacific Ocean. The excitement caused by ['seen', 'this news'] was extreme. ['a steamer of the line of San Francisco, from California to Shanghai', 'The ship'] was revictualled and well stocked with coal. 
 
Three hours before the _Abraham Lincoln_ left Brooklyn pier, I received a letter worded as follows:— 
 
“To M. ARONNAX, Professor in the Museum of Paris, Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York. 
 
“SIR,—If ['you', 'your'] will consent to join the _Abraham Lincoln_ in ['this expedition', 'the enterprise'], the Government of the United States will with pleasure see France represented in ['this expedition', 'the enterprise']. Commander Farragut has a cabin at ['you', 'your'] disposal. 
 
“Very cordially yours, “J.B. HOBSON, “Secretary of Marine.” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER III I FORM MY RESOLUTION 
 
Three seconds before the arrival of ['J. B. Hobson’s letter', 'the letter of the honourable ['J. B. Hobson’s', 'the honourable Secretary of Marine']arine'], ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] no more thought of pursuing ['the unicorn', 'this disturbing monster', 'it'] than of attempting the passage of the North Sea. Three seconds after reading ['J. B. Hobson’s letter', 'the letter of th['J. B. Hobson’s', 'the honourable Secretary of Marine'], ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] felt that ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] true vocation, the sole end of ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] life, was to chase ['the unicorn', 'this disturbing monster', 'it'], and purge ['the unicorn', 'this disturbing monster', 'it'] from the world. 
 
But ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I'] had just returned from a fatiguing journey, weary and longing for repose. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I'] aspired to nothing more than again seeing ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I'] country, ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I'] friends, ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I'] little lodging by the Jardin des Plantes, ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I'] dear and precious collections. But nothing could keep ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I'] back! ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I'] forgot all—fatigue, friends and collections—and accepted without hesitation the offer of the American Government. 
 
“Besides,” thought ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I'], “all roads lead back to ['Europe', 'Europe'] (for ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I'] particular benefit), and ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I'] will not hurry ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I'] towards the coast of ['France', 'France']. ['This worthy animal', 'itself', 'his', 'this narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean, which, to return to France, was taking the road to the antipodes'] may allow ['This worthy animal', 'itself', 'his', 'this narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean, which, to return to France, was taking the road to the antipodes'] to be caught in the seas of ['Europe', 'Europe'] (for ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I'] particular benefit), and ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I'] will not bring back less than half a yard of ['This worthy animal', 'itself', 'his', 'this narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean, which, to return to France, was taking the road to the antipodes'] ivory halberd to the Museum of Natural History.” But in the meanwhile ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I'] must seek ['This worthy animal', 'itself', 'his', 'this narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean, which, to return to Fr['France', 'France']was taking the road to the antipodes']. 
 
“Conseil,” I called in an impatient voice. 
 
['Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his'] was ['my', 'me', 'my', 'I'] servant, a true, devoted Flemish boy, who had accompanied ['my', 'me', 'my', 'I'] in all ['my', 'me', 'my', 'I'] travels. ['my', 'me', 'my', 'I'] ['liked', 'the liking'] ['Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his'], and ['Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his'] returned ['liked', 'the liking'] well. ['Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his'] was phlegmatic by nature, regular from principle, zealous from habit, evincing little disturbance at the different surprises of life, very quick with ['Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his'] hands, and apt at any service required of ['Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his']; and, despite ['Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his'] name, never giving ['advice', 'it']—even when asked for ['advice', 'it']. 
 
['Conseil', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'This boy', 'his', 'his'] had followed ['me', 'I', 'I'] for the last ten years wherever science led. Never once did ['Conseil', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'This boy', 'his', 'his'] complain of the length or fatigue of a journey, never make an objection to pack ['Conseil', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'This boy', 'his', 'hi['his portmanteau', 'it'] for whatever country ['his portmanteau', 'it'] might be, or however far away, whether China or Congo. Besides all this, ['Conseil', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'This boy', 'his', 'his'] had good health, which defied all sickness, and solid muscles, but no nerves; good morals are understood. ['Conseil', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'This boy', 'his', 'his'] was thirty years old, and ['Conseil', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'This boy', 'his', 'his'] age to that of ['Conseil', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'This boy', 'his', 'his'] master as fifteen to twenty. May ['me', 'I', 'I'] be excused for saying that ['me', 'I', 'I'] was forty years old? 
 
But ['Conseil', 'he'] had one fault: ['Conseil', 'he'] was ceremonious to a degree, and would never speak to me but in the third person, which was sometimes provoking. 
 
“Conseil,” said ['I', 'my'] again, beginning with feverish hands to make preparations for ['I', 'my'] departure. 
 
Certainly ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] was sure of ['this devoted boy', 'him', 'him', 'the most impassive man in the world']. As a rule, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] never asked ['this devoted boy', 'him', 'him', 'the most impassive man in the world'] if it were convenient for ['this devoted boy', 'him', 'him', 'the most impassive man in the world'] or not to follow ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] in ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] travels; but this time ['the expedition in question', 'the enterprise'] might be prolonged, and ['the expedition in question', 'the enterprise'] might be hazardous in pursuit of an animal capable of sinking a frigate as easily as a nutshell. Here there was matter for reflection even to ['this devoted boy', 'him', 'him', 'the most impassive man in the world']. What would Conseil say? 
 
“Conseil,” I called a third time. 
 
Conseil appeared. 
 
“Did ['you', 'sir', 'he'] call, ['you', 'sir', 'he']?” said ['you', 'sir', 'he'], entering. 
 
“Yes, ['my', 'me['my boy', 'yourself']; make preparations for ['my', 'me'] and ['my boy', 'yourself'] too. We leave in two hours.” 
 
“As ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil'] please, ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil'],” replied ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil'], quietly. 
 
“Not an instant to lose;—lock in my trunk all travelling utensils, coats, shirts, and stockings—without counting, as many as you can, and make haste.” 
 
“And your collections, sir?” observed Conseil. 
 
“We will think of them by and by.” 
 
“What! the archiotherium, the hyracotherium, the oreodons, the cheropotamus, and the other skins?” 
 
“They will keep them at the hotel.” 
 
“And your live Babiroussa, sir?” 
 
“They will feed it during ['our', 'our'] absence; besides, I will give orders to forward ['our', 'our'] menagerie to France.” 
 
“We are not returning to Paris, then?” said Conseil. 
 
“Oh! certainly,” I answered, evasively, “by making a curve.” 
 
“Will the curve please ['you', 'sir'], ['you', 'sir']?” 
 
“Oh! it will be nothing; not quite so direct a road, that is all. ['We', 'our'] take ['We', 'our'] passage in the _Abraham Lincoln_.” 
 
“As ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil'] think proper, ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil'],” coolly replied ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil']. 
 
“You see, my friend, it has to do with ['the monster—the famous narwhal', 'it']. ['We', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'we'] are going to purge ['the monster—the famous narwhal', 'it'] from the seas. The author of a work in quarto in two volumes, on the ‘Mysteries of the Great Submarine Grounds’ cannot forbear embarking with Commander Farragut. A glorious mission, but a dangerous one! ['We', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'we'] cannot tell where ['We', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'we'] may go; these animals can be very capricious. But ['We', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'we'] will go whether or no; ['We', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'we'] have got a captain who is pretty wide-awake.” 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] opened a credit account for ['Babiroussa', 'the frigate'], and, Conseil following, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] jumped into a cab. Our luggage was transported to the deck of ['Babiroussa', 'the frigate'] immediately. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] hastened on board and asked for Commander Farragut. One of the sailors conducted ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] to the poop, where ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] found ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] in the presence of ['a good-looking officer, who held out his hand ['a good-looking officer, who held out his hand to me', 'his']me', 'his['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'me']. 
 
“Monsieur Pierre Aronnax?” said he. 
 
“Himself,” replied I; “Commander Farragut?” 
 
“['You', 'Professor', 'your', 'you'] are welcome, ['You', 'Professor', 'your', 'you']; ['You', 'Professor', 'your', 'you'] cabin is ready for ['You', 'Professor', 'your', 'you'].” 
 
['I', 'me'] bowed, and desired to be conducted to the cabin destined for ['I', 'me']. 
 
['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'She', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'this gigantic cetacean'] had been well chosen and equipped for ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'She', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'this gigantic cetacean'] new destination. ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'She', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'this gigantic cetacean'] was a frigate of great speed, fitted with high-pressure engines which admitted ['a pressure of seven atmospheres', 'this']. Under ['a pressure of seven atmospheres', 'this'] ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'She', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'this gigantic cetacean'] attained the mean speed of nearly eighteen knots and a third an hour—a considerable speed, but, nevertheless, insufficient to grapple with ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'She', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'this gigantic cetacean']. 
 
The interior arrangements of ['the frigate', 'its'] corresponded to ['the frigate', 'its'] nautical qualities. ['I', 'my'] was well satisfied with ['I', 'my'] cabin, which was in the after part, opening upon the gunroom. 
 
“We shall be well off here,” said I to Conseil. 
 
“As well, by your honour’s leave, as a hermit-crab in the shell of a whelk,” said Conseil. 
 
I left Conseil to stow our trunks conveniently away, and remounted the poop in order to survey the preparations for departure. 
 
At that moment Commander Farragut was ordering the last moorings to be cast loose which held ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the frigate'] to the pier of Brooklyn. So in a quarter of an hour, perhaps less, ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the frigate'] would have sailed without ['me', 'I']. ['me', 'I'] should have missed this extraordinary, supernatural, and incredible expedition, the recital of which may well meet with some scepticism. 
 
But ['Commander Farragut', 'He'] would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the seas in which the animal had been sighted. ['Commander Farragut', 'He'] sent for the engineer. 
 
“Is the steam full on?” asked he. 
 
“Yes, sir,” replied the engineer. 
 
“Go ahead,” cried Commander Farragut. 
 
The quay of Brooklyn, and all that part of ['New York', 'New York'] bordering on the East River, was crowded with spectators. Three cheers burst successively from five hundred thousand throats; thousands of handkerchiefs were waved above the heads of the compact mass, saluting ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'her', 'The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'it', 'it'], until ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'her', 'The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'it', 'it'] reached the waters of ['the Hudson', 'the beautiful river'], at the point of that elongated peninsula which forms the town of ['New York', 'New York']. Then ['the frigate', 'the frigate', 'her'], following the coast of New Jersey along the right bank of ['the Hudson', 'the beautiful river'], covered with villas, passed between ['the forts, which saluted her with th['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'her', 'The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'it', 'it'] heavi['the forts, which saluted her with their heaviest guns', 'their']uns', 'their']. ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'her', 'The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'it', 'it'] answered by hoisting the American colours three times, whose thirty-nine stars shone resplendent from the mizzen-peak; then modifying ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'her', 'The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'it', 'it'] speed to take the narrow channel marked by buoys placed in the inner bay formed by Sandy Hook Point, ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'her', 'The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'it', 'it'] coasted the long sandy beach, where some thousands of spectators gave ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'her', 'The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'it', 'it'] one final cheer. ['The escort of boats and tenders', 'they'] still followed ['the frigate', 'the frigate', 'her'], and did not leave ['the frigate', 'the frigate', 'her'] until ['The escort of boats and tenders', 'they'] came abreast of the lightship, whose two lights marked the entrance of New York Channel. 
 
Six bells struck, ['the pilot', 'his'] got into ['the pilot', 'his'] boat, and rejoined ['the little schooner which was waiting under our lee', 'the frigate', 'she'], the fires were made up, the screw beat the waves more rapidly, ['the little schooner which was waiting under our lee', 'the frigate', 'she'] skirted the low yellow coast of Long Island; and at eight bells, after having lost sight in the north-west of the lights of Fire Island, ['the little schooner which was waiting under our lee', 'the frigate', 'she'] ran at full steam on to the dark waters of the Atlantic. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER IV NED LAND 
 
['Captain Farragut', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'Captain Farragut', 'the captain'] was a good seaman, worthy of ['the frigate he commanded', 'His ve['Captain Farragut', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'Captain Farragut', 'the captain']el', 'it']. ['Captain Farragut', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'Captain Farragut', 'the captai['the frigate he commanded', 'His vessel', 'it'] and ['Captain Farragut', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'Captain Farragut', 'the captain'] were one. ['Captain Farragut', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'Captain Farragut', 'the captain'] was the soul of ['the frigate he commanded', 'His vessel', 'it']. On the question of ['the cetacean', 'the animal', 'The monster', 'he', 'it', 'He'] there was no doubt in ['Captain Farragut', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'Captain Farragut', 'the captain'] mind, and ['Captain Farragut', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'Captain Farragut', 'the captain'] would not allow ['the existence of the anim['the cetacean', 'the animal', 'The monster', 'he', 'it', 'He'] to be disputed on board. ['Captain Farragut', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'Captain Farragut', 'the captain'] believed in ['the existence of the animal', 'it'], as certain good women believe in the leviathan—by faith, not by reason. ['the cetacean', 'the animal', 'The monster', 'he', 'it', 'He'] did exist, and ['the cetacean', 'the animal', 'The monster', 'he', 'it', 'He'] had sworn to rid the seas of ['the cetacean', 'the animal', 'The monster', 'he', 'it', 'He']. ['the cetacean', 'the animal', 'The monster', 'he', 'it', 'He'] was a kind of Knight of Rhodes, a second Dieudonné de Gozon, going to meet the serpent which desolated the island. Either ['Captain Farragut', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'Captain Farragut', 'the captain'] would kill ['the narwhal', 'the narwhal'], or ['the narwhal', 'the narwhal'] would kill ['Captain Farragut', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'Captain Farragut', 'the captain']. There was no third course. 
 
['The officers on board', 'their', 'T['board', 'board'] shared the opinion of ['The officers on board', 'their', 'They'] chief. ['The officers on board', 'their', 'They'] were ever chatting, discussing, and calculating the various chances of a meeting, watching narrowly the vast surface of ['the ocean', 'the Pacific', 'the sea']. ['More than one', 'his'] took up ['More than one', 'his'] quarters voluntarily in the cross-trees, who would have cursed such a berth under any other circumstances. As long as ['the sun', 'its'] described ['the sun', 'its'] daily course, the rigging was crowded with sailors, whose feet were burnt to such an extent by the heat of the deck as to render it unbearable; still ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the ship’s', 'the unicorn', 'it', 'it', 'it'] had not yet breasted the suspected waters of ['the ocean', 'the Pacific', 'the sea']. As to ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the ship’s', 'the unicorn', 'it', '['the ship’s company', 'they', 'They'], ['the ship’s company', 'they', 'They'] desired nothing better than to meet ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the ship’s', 'the unicorn', 'it', 'it', 'it'], to harpoon ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the ship’s', 'the unicorn', 'it', 'it', 'it'], hoist ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the ship’s', 'the unicorn', 'it', 'it', 'it'] on ['board', 'board'], and despatch ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the ship’s', 'the unicorn', 'it', 'it', 'it']. ['the ship’s company', 'they', 'They'] watched ['the ocean', 'the Pacific', 'the sea'] with eager attention. 
 
Besides, Captain Farragut had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand dollars, set apart for whoever should first sight the monster, were he cabin-boy, common seaman, or officer. 
 
I leave you to judge how eyes were used on board the _Abraham Lincoln_. 
 
For ['my', 'I', 'my'] own part ['my', 'I', 'my'] was not behind the others, and left to no one ['my', 'I', 'my'] share of daily observations. The frigate might have been called the _Argus_, for a hundred reasons. ['Only one amongst us, Conse['us', 'us all']', 'his'], seemed to protest by ['Only one amongst us, Conseil', 'his'] indifference against the question which so interested ['us', 'us all'], and seemed to be out of keeping with the general enthusiasm on board. 
 
I have said that ['Captain Farragut', 'his'] had carefully provided ['Captain Farragut', 'hi['his ship', 'We'] with every apparatus for catching the gigantic cetacean. No whaler had ever been better armed. ['his ship', 'We'] possessed every known engine, from the harpoon thrown by the hand to the barbed arrows of the blunderbuss, and the explosive balls of the duck-gun. On the forecastle lay the perfection of ['a breech-loading gun', 'This precious weapon of American origin'], very thick at the breech, and very narrow in the bore, the model of which had been in the Exhibition of 1867. ['a breech-loading gun', 'This precious weapon of American origin'] could throw with ease a conical projectile of nine pounds to a mean distance of ten miles. 
 
Thus ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she'] wanted for no means of destruction; and, what was better still, ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she'] had on board Ned Land, the prince of harpooners. 
 
['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'his'] was a Canadian, with an uncommon quickness of hand, and who knew no equal in ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'his'] dangerous occupation. Skill, coolness, audacity, and cunning ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'his'] possessed in a superior degree, and it must be a cunning whale or a singularly “cute” cachalot to escape the stroke of ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'his'] harpoon. 
 
['Ned Land', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'his'] was about forty years of age; ['Ned Land', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'his'] was a tall man (more than six feet high), strongly built, grave and taciturn, occasionally violent, and very passionate when contradicted. ['Ned Land', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'his'] person attracted attention, but above all the boldness of ['Ned Land', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'his'] look, which gave a singular expression to ['Ned Land', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'his'] face. 
 
Who calls himself Canadian calls ['himself', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'The harpooner’s'] French; and, little communicative as Ned Land was, ['I', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'me'] must admit that ['himself', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'The harpooner’s'] took a certain liking for ['I', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'me']. ['I', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'me'] nationality drew ['himself', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'The harpooner’s'] to ['I', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'me'], no doubt. It was an opportunity for ['himself', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'The harpooner’s'] to talk, and for ['I', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'me'] to hear, that old language of Rabelais, which is still in use in some Canadian provinces. ['himself', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'The harpooner’s'] family was originally from Quebec, and was already a tribe of hardy fishermen when this town belonged to France. 
 
Little by little, ['Ned Land', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his'] acquired a taste for chatting, and ['I', 'I'] loved to hear ['the recital of his adventures in['Ned Land', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his']e polar seas', 'his recital']. ['Ned Land', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his'] related ['Ned Land', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his'] fishing, and ['Ned Land', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his'] combats, with natural poetry of expression; ['Ned Land', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'hi['the recital of his adventures in the polar seas', 'his recital'] took the form of an epic poem, and ['I', 'I'] seemed to be listening to a Canadian Homer singing the Iliad of the regions of the North. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am portraying ['this hardy companion', 'him', 'brave Ned', 'your'] as ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] really knew ['this hardy companion', 'him', 'brave Ned', 'your']. We are old friends now, united in that unchangeable friendship which is born and cemented amidst extreme dangers. Ah, ['this hardy companion', 'him', 'brave Ned', 'your']! ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] ask no more than to live a hundred years longer, that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] may have more time to dwell the longer on ['this hardy companion', 'him', 'brave Ned', 'your'] memory. 
 
Now, what was ['Ned Land’s', 'he', 'He', 'him'] opinion upon ['the question of the marine monster', 'the subject, which I one day thought it my duty to press upon him']? ['I', 'I', 'my'] must admit that ['Ned Land’s', 'he', 'He', 'him'] did not ['believe', 'that universal conviction'] in the unicorn, and was the only one on board who did not share ['believe', 'that universal conviction']. ['Ned Land’s', 'he', 'He', 'him'] even avoided ['the question of the marine monster', 'the subject, which I ['I', 'I', 'my']ne day thought it my['I', 'I', 'my']uty to press upon hi['Ned Land’s', 'he', 'He', 'him']. One magnificent evening, the 30th of July—that is to say, three weeks after ['our', 'We'] departure—the frigate was abreast of Cape Blanc, thirty miles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia. ['our', 'We'] had crossed the tropic of Capricorn, and the Straits of Magellan opened less than seven hundred miles to the south. Before eight days were over the _Abraham Lincoln_ would be ploughing the waters of the Pacific. 
 
Seated on the poop, ['Ned Land['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'himself', 'him'] 'we'['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] were ['chatting', 'the conversation'] of one thing and another as ['Ned Land and I', 'we'] looked at this mysterious sea, whose great depths had up to this time been inaccessible to the eye of man. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] naturally led up ['chatting', 'the conversation'] to the giant unicorn, and examined the various chances of success or failure of the expedition. But, seeing that ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'himself', 'him'] let ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] speak without saying too much ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'himself', 'him'], ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] pressed ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'himself', 'him'] more closely. 
 
“Well, ['Ned', 'you', 'you'],” said I, “is it possible that ['Ned', 'you', 'you'] are not convinced of the existence of this cetacean that we are following? Have ['Ned', 'you', 'you'] any particular reason for being so incredulous?” 
 
['The harpooner', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'himself', 'I'] looked at me fixedly for some moments before answering, struck ['The harpooner', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'himself', 'I'] broad forehead with ['The harpooner', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'himself', 'I'] hand (a habit of ['The harpooner', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'himself', 'I']), as if to collect ['The harpooner', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'himself', 'I'], and said at last, “Perhaps ['The harpooner', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'himself', 'I'] have, Mr. Aronnax.” 
 
“But, Ned, you, a whaler by profession, familiarised with all the great marine mammalia—you, whose imagination might easily accept the hypothesis of enormous cetaceans, _you_ ought to be the last to doubt under such circumstances!” 
 
“That is just what deceives ['you', 'Professor', 'Ned', 'I'], ['you', 'Professor', 'Ned', 'I'],” replied ['you', 'Professor', 'Ned', 'I']. “That the vulgar should believe in extraordinary comets traversing space, and in the existence of antediluvian monsters in the heart of the globe, may well be; but neither astronomer nor geologist believes in such chimeras. As a whaler ['you', 'Professor', 'Ned', 'I'] have followed many a cetacean, harpooned a great number, and killed several; but, however strong or well-armed ['they', 'their', 'their'] may have been, neither ['they', 'their', 'their'] tails nor ['they', 'their', 'their'] weapons would have been able even to scratch the iron plates of a steamer.” 
 
“But, Ned, they tell of ships which the teeth of the narwhal have pierced through and through.” 
 
“['Wooden ships', 'that', 'it']—['Wooden ships', 'that', 'it'] is possible,” replied ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I', 'you'], “but ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I', 'you'] have never seen ['Wooden ships', 'that', 'it'] done; and, until further proof, ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I', 'you'] deny that whales, cetaceans, or sea-unicorns could ever produce the effect ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I', 'you'] describe.” 
 
“Well, Ned, ['I', 'I'] repeat it with a conviction resting on the logic of facts. ['I', 'I'] believe in the existence of a mammal power fully organised, belonging to the branch of vertebrata, like the whales, the cachalots, or the dolphins, and furnished with a horn of defence of great penetrating power.” 
 
“Hum!” said ['the harpooner', 'his'], shaking ['the harpooner', 'his'] head with the air of a man who would not be convinced. 
 
“Notice one thing, ['my', 'I'] worthy Canadian,” ['my', 'I'] resumed. “If ['such an animal', 'it', 'it', 'it'] is in existence, if ['such an animal', 'it', 'it', 'it'] inhabits the depths of the ocean, if ['such an animal', 'it', 'it', 'it'] frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water, ['such an animal', 'it', 'it', 'it'] must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would defy all comparison.” 
 
“And why this powerful organisation?” demanded Ned. 
 
“Because it requires incalculable strength to keep one’s self in ['these strata', 'their'] and resist ['these strata', 'their'] pressure. Listen to ['me', 'my']. Let us admit that the pressure of ['the atmosphere', 'the atmosphere', 'its'] is represented by the weight of ['a column of water thirty-two feet high', 'the column of water']. In reality ['a column of water thirty-two feet high', 'the column of water'] would be shorter, as we are speaking of sea water, the density of which is greater than that of fresh water. Very well, when ['you', 'Ned', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'my brave Ned', 'you', 'you', 'your'] dive, ['you', 'Ned', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'my brave Ned', 'you', 'you', 'your'], as many times thirty-two feet of water as there are above ['you', 'Ned', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'my brave Ned', 'you', 'you', 'your'], so many times does ['you', 'Ned', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'my brave Ned', 'you', 'you', 'your'] body bear ['a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere, tha['the atmosphere', 'the atmosphere', 'its']5 lbs. for each square inch of its surface', 'this['the atmosphere', 'the atmosphere', 'its']essure']. It follows, then, that at 320 feet ['a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere, that is to say, 15 lbs. for each square inch of its surface', 'this pressure'] = that of 10 atmospheres, of 100 atmospheres at 3200 feet, and of 1000 atmospheres at 32,000 feet, that is, about 6 miles; which is equivalent to saying that if ['you', 'Ned', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'my brave Ned', 'you', 'you', 'your'] could attain this depth in the ocean, each square three-eighths of an inch of ['the surface of your body', 'the surface of yo['you', 'Ned', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'my brave Ned', 'you', 'you', 'your']ody'] would bear a pressure of 5600 lbs. Ah! ['you', 'Ned', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'my brave Ned', 'you', 'y['me', 'my']', 'your'], do ['you', 'Ned', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'my brave Ned', 'you', 'you', 'your'] know how many square inches ['you', 'Ned', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'my brave Ned', 'you', 'you', 'your'] carry on ['the surface of your body', 'the surface of yo['you', 'Ned', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'my brave Ned', 'you', 'you', 'your']ody']?” 
 
“I have no idea, Mr. Aronnax.” 
 
“About 6500; and, as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about 15 lbs. to the square inch, your 6500 square inches bear at this moment a pressure of 97,500 lbs.” 
 
“Without my perceiving it?” 
 
“Without your perceiving it. And if you are not crushed by such a pressure, it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body with equal pressure. Hence perfect equilibrium between the interior and exterior pressure, which thus neutralise each other, and which allows you to bear ['it', 'it'] without inconvenience. But in the water ['it', 'it'] is another thing.” 
 
“Yes, ['I', 'Ned', 'me'] understand,” replied ['I', 'Ned', 'me'], becoming more attentive; “because the water surrounds ['I', 'Ned', 'me'], but does not penetrate.” 
 
“Precisely, ['Ned', 'you', 'you']: so that at 32 feet beneath the surface of the sea ['Ned', 'you', 'you'] would undergo ['a pressure of 97,500 lbs.', 'that pressure', 'that pressure', 'that pressure']; at 320 feet, ten times ['a pressure of 97,500 lbs.', 'that pressure', 'that pressure', 'that pressure']; at 3200 feet, a hundred times ['a pressure of 97,500 lbs.', 'that pressure', 'that pressure', 'that pressure']; lastly, at 32,000 feet, a thousand times ['a pressure of 97,500 lbs.', 'that pressure', 'that pressure', 'that pressure'] would be 97,500,000 lbs.—that is to say, that ['Ned', 'you', 'you'] would be flattened as if you had been drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine!” 
 
“The devil!” exclaimed Ned. 
 
“Very well, ['my worthy harpooner', 'itself'], if ['some vertebrate, several hundred yards long, and large in proportion', 'they', 'their', 'their'], can maintain ['my worthy harpooner', 'itself'] in such depths—of those whose surface is represented by millions of square inches, that is by tens of millions of pounds, we must estimate the pressure ['some vertebrate, several hundred yards long, and large in proportion', 'they', 'their', 'their'] undergo. Consider, then, what must be the resistance of ['some vertebrate, several hundred yards long, and large in proportion', 'they', 'their', 'their'] bony structure, and the strength of ['some vertebrate, several hundred yards long, and large in proportion', 'they', 'their', 'their'] organisation to withstand such pressure!” 
 
“Why!” exclaimed Ned Land, “they must be made of iron plates eight inches thick, like the armoured frigates.” 
 
“As ['you', 'Ned'] say, ['you', 'Ned']. And think what destruction such a mass would cause, if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a vessel.” 
 
“Yes—certainly—perhaps,” replied the Canadian, shaken by these figures, but not yet willing to give in. 
 
“Well, have I convinced you?” 
 
“['You', 'sir', 'you'] have convinced me of one thing, ['You', 'sir', 'you'], which is that, if ['such animals', 'they'] do exist at the bottom of the seas, ['such animals', 'they'] must necessarily be as strong as ['You', 'sir', 'you'] say.” 
 
“But if they do not exist, mine obstinate harpooner, how explain the accident to the _Scotia?_” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER V AT A VENTURE 
 
The voyage of the _Abraham Lincoln_ was for a long time marked by no special incident. But one circumstance happened which showed the wonderful dexterity of ['Ned Land', 'him'], and proved what confidence we might place in ['Ned Land', 'him']. 
 
The 30th of June, the frigate spoke ['some American whalers, from whom we learned that they knew nothing ['some American whalers, from whom we learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal', 'they', 'them']t the narwhal', 'they', 'them']. But ['one of them, the['some American whalers, from whom we learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal', 'they', 'them']tain of the _Monr['the _Monroe_', 'the _Monroe_'], knowing that ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'him', 'our Canadian', 'he'] had shipped on board the _Abraham Lincoln_, begged for ['one of them, the captain of the _Monroe_', 'his'] help in chasing a whale they had in sight. Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'him', 'our Canadian', 'he'] at work, gave ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'him', 'our Canadian', 'he'] permission to go on board ['the _Monroe_', 'the _Monroe_']. And fate served ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'him', 'our Canadian', 'he'] so well that, instead of one whale, ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'him', 'our Canadian', 'he'] harpooned two with a double blow, striking one straight to the heart, and catching the other after some minutes’ pursuit. 
 
Decidedly, if ['the monster', 'its'] ever had to do with Ned Land’s harpoon, I would not bet in ['the monster', 'its'] favour. 
 
The frigate skirted the south-east coast of America with great rapidity. The 3rd of July we were at the opening of the Straits of Magellan, level with Cape Vierges. But Commander Farragut would not take a tortuous passage, but doubled Cape Horn. 
 
['The ship’s crew', 'the sailors'] agreed with him. And certainly it was possible that they might meet ['the narwhal', 'the monster', 'he'] in this narrow pass. Many of ['The ship’s crew', 'the sailors'] affirmed that ['the narwhal', 'the monster', 'he'] could not ['pass', 'that'] there, “that ['the narwhal', 'the monster', 'he'] was too big for ['pass', 'that']!” 
 
The 6th of July, about three o’clock in the afternoon, ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the frigate'], at fifteen miles to the south, doubled the solitary island, this lost rock at the extremity of the American continent, to which ['some Dutch sailors', 'their'] gave the name of ['some Dutch sailors', 'their'] native town, Cape Horn. The course was taken towards the north-west, and the next day the screw of ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the frigate'] was at last beating the waters of the Pacific. 
 
“Keep ['your', 'the sailors'] eyes open!” called out ['your', 'the sailors']. 
 
And ['they', 'they'] were opened widely. Both eyes and glasses, a little dazzled, it is true, by the prospect of two thousand dollars, had not an instant’s repose. Day and night ['they', 'they'] watched the surface of the ocean, and even nyctalopes, whose faculty of seeing in the darkness multiplies their chances a hundredfold, would have had enough to do to gain the prize. 
 
['I myself, for whom money had no charms', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'], was not the least attentive on board. Giving but few minutes to ['I myself, for whom money had no charms', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] meals, but a few hours to sleep, indifferent to either rain or sunshine, ['I myself, for whom money had no charms', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] did not leave ['the poop of the vessel', 'The poop of th['the vessel', 'the vessel', 'the cetacean']. Now leaning on the netting of the forecastle, now on the taffrail, ['I myself, for whom money had no charms', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the sea as far as the eye could reach; and how often have ['I myself, for whom money had no charms', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] shared the emotion of the majority of the crew, when ['some capricious whale', 'its'] raised ['some capricious whale', 'its'] black back above the waves! ['the poop of the vessel', 'The poop of th['the vessel', 'the vessel', 'the cetacean'] was crowded in a moment. The cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers, each with heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of ['the vessel', 'the vessel', 'the cetacean']. ['I myself, for whom money had no charms', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] looked and looked, till ['I myself, for whom money had no charms', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was nearly blind, whilst Conseil, always phlegmatic, kept repeating in a calm voice: 
 
“If, ['sir', 'you', 'you'], ['sir', 'you', 'you'] would not squint so much, ['sir', 'you', 'you'] would see better!” 
 
But vain excitement! ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its'] checked ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its'] speed and made for the animal signalled, a simple whale, or common cachalot, which soon disappeared amidst a storm of execration. 
 
But the weather was good. The voyage was being accomplished under the most favourable auspices. It was then the bad season in Australia, the July of that zone corresponding to our January in Europe, but the sea was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference. 
 
The 20th of July, the tropic of Capricorn was cut by 105° of longitude, and the 27th of the same month ['we', 'the frigate', 'The frigate', 'We', 'we', 'The entire ship’s', 'us'] crossed the equator on the 110th meridian. This passed, ['we', 'the frigate', 'The frigate', 'We', 'we', 'The entire ship’s', 'us'] took a more decided westerly direction, and scoured the central waters of the Pacific. Commander Farragut thought, and with reason, that it was better to remain in deep water, and keep clear of continents or islands, which ['the beast itself', 'itself', 'him', 'the mon['the beast itself', 'itself', 'him', 'the monster'] seemed to shun (perhaps because there was not enough water for ['the beast itself', 'itself', 'him', 'the monster']! suggested the greater part of ['the crew', 'The entire ship’s crew', 'they', 'they']). ['we', 'the frigate', 'The frigate', 'We', 'we', 'The entire ship’s', 'us'] passed at some distance from the Marquesas and the Sandwich Islands, crossed the tropic of Cancer, and made for the China Seas. ['we', 'the frigate', 'The frigate', 'We', 'we', 'The entire ship’s', 'us'] were on the theatre of the last diversions of ['the beast itself', 'itself', 'him', 'the monster']: and, to say truth, ['we', 'the frigate', 'The frigate', 'We', 'we', 'The entire ship’s', 'us'] no longer _lived_ on board. ['Hearts', 'themselves'] palpitated, fearfully preparing ['Hearts', 'themselves'] for future incurable aneurism. ['we', 'the frigate', 'The frigate', 'We', 'we', 'The enti['the crew', 'The entire ship’s crew', 'they', 'they'] were undergoing a nervous excitement, of which I can give no idea: ['the crew', 'The entire ship’s crew', 'they', 'they'] could not eat, ['the crew', 'The entire ship’s crew', 'they', 'they'] could not sleep—twenty times a day, a misconception or an optical illusion of some sailor seated on the taffrail, would cause dreadful perspirations, and these emotions, twenty times repeated, kept ['we', 'the frigate', 'The frigate', 'We', 'we', 'The entire ship’s', 'us'] in a state of excitement so violent that a reaction was unavoidable. 
 
And truly, ['reaction', 'itself'] soon showed ['reaction', 'itself']. For three months, during which a day seemed an age, ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'her'] furrowed all the waters of the Northern Pacific, running at whales, making sharp deviations from ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'her'] course, veering suddenly from one tack to another, stopping suddenly, putting on steam, and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'her'] machinery, and not one point of the Japanese or American coast was left unexplored. 
 
The warmest partisans of ['the enterprise', 'its'] now became ['the enterprise', 'its'] most ardent detractors. Reaction mounted from the crew to ['the captain himself', 'hi['the captain himself', 'himself'], and certainly, had it not been for resolute determination on the part of Captain Farragut, the frigate would have headed due southward. This useless search could not last much longer. ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'herself', 'she', 'her'] had nothing to reproach ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'herself', 'she', 'her'] with, ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'herself', 'she', 'her'] had done ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'herself', 'she', 'her'] best to succeed. Never had ['an American ship’s crew', 'its', 'their'] shown more zeal or patience; ['an American ship’s crew', 'its', 'their'] failure could not be placed to ['an American ship’s crew', 'its', 'their'] charge—there remained nothing but to return. 
 
This was represented to ['the commander', 'Captain Farragut', 'the man at the helm']. ['The sailors', 'their'] could not hide ['The sailors', 'their'] discontent, and the service suffered. I will not say there was a mutiny on board, but after a reasonable period of obstinacy, ['the commander', 'Captain Farragut', 'the man at the helm'] (as Columbus did) asked for three days’ patience. If in three days the monster did not appear, ['the commander', 'Captain Farragut', 'the man at the helm'] should give three turns of the wheel, and the _Abraham Lincoln_ would make for the European seas. 
 
['This promise', 'It'] was made on the 2nd of November. ['This promise', 'It'] had the effect of rallying the ship’s crew. The ocean was watched with renewed attention. ['Each one', 'his'] wished for a last glance in which to sum up ['Each one', 'his'] remembrance. Glasses were used with feverish activity. It was a grand defiance given to ['the giant narwhal', 'he'], and ['the giant narwhal', 'he'] could scarcely fail to answer the summons and “appear.” 
 
Two days passed, the steam was at half pressure; a thousand schemes were tried to attract the attention and stimulate the apathy of ['the animal', 'it'] in case ['the animal', 'it'] should be met in those parts. Large quantities of bacon were trailed in the wake of ['the ship', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she'], to the great satisfaction (I must say) of the sharks. Small craft radiated in all directions round ['the ship', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she'] as ['the ship', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she'] lay to, and did not leave a spot of the sea unexplored. But the night of the 4th of November arrived without the unveiling of this submarine mystery. 
 
The next day, the 5th of November, at twelve, the delay would (morally speaking) expire; after that time, ['Commander Farragut', 'his'], faithful to ['Commander Farragut', 'his'] promise, was to turn the course to the south-east and abandon for ever the northern regions of the Pacific. 
 
['The frigate', 'the vessel'] was then in 31° 15′ north latitude and 136° 42′ east longitude. The coast of Japan still remained less than two hundred miles to leeward. Night was approaching. They had just struck eight bells; large clouds veiled the face of ['the moon', 'its'], then in ['the moon', 'its'] first quarter. The sea undulated peaceably under the stern of ['The frigate', 'the vessel']. 
 
At that moment ['I', 'me'] was leaning forward on the starboard netting. ['Conseil', 'him'], standing near ['I', 'me'], was looking straight before ['Conseil', 'him']. The crew, perched in the ratlines, examined the horizon, which contracted and darkened by degrees. ['Officers with their night['Officers with their night glasses', 'their']ses', 'their'] scoured ['the growing darkness', 'the darkness']; sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the moon, which darted between two clouds, then all trace of light was lost in ['the growing darkness', 'the darkness']. 
 
In looking at ['Conseil', 'he', 'his'], ['I', 'I'] could see ['Conseil', 'he', 'his'] was undergoing a little of the general influence. At least ['I', 'I'] thought so. Perhaps for the first time ['Conseil', 'he', 'his'] nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity. 
 
“Come, Conseil,” said I, “this is the last chance of pocketing the two thousand dollars.” 
 
“May ['I', 'Conseil', 'I'] be permitted to say, sir,” replied ['I', 'Conseil', 'I'], “that ['I', 'Conseil', 'I'] never reckoned on getting the prize; and, had the government of the Union offered a hundred thousand dollars, it would have been none the poorer.” 
 
“['You', 'Conseil'] are right, ['You', 'Conseil']. It is a foolish affair after all, and one upon which ['we', 'We'] entered too lightly. What time lost, what useless emotions! ['we', 'We'] should have been back in France six months ago.” 
 
“In ['your', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'your', 'sir', 'I', 'your', 'sir'] little room, ['your', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'your', 'sir', 'I', 'your', 'sir'],” replied ['your', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'your', 'sir', 'I', 'your', 'sir'], “and in ['your', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'your', 'sir', 'I', 'your', 'sir'] museum, ['your', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'your', 'sir', 'I', 'your', 'sir'], and ['your', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'your', 'sir', 'I', 'your', 'sir'] should have already classed all ['your', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'your', 'sir', 'I', 'your', 'sir'] fossils, ['your', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'your', 'sir', 'I', 'your', 'sir']. And ['the Babiroussa', 'its'] would have been installed in ['the Babiroussa', 'its'] cage in the Jardin des Plantes, and have drawn all the curious people of the capital!” 
 
“As you say, Conseil. I fancy ['we', 'our'] shall run a fair chance of being laughed at for ['we', 'our'] pains.” 
 
“That’s tolerably certain,” replied ['Conseil', 'I', 'you', 'sir', 'I'], quietly; “['Conseil', 'I', 'you', 'sir', 'I'] ['think', 'it'] they will make fun of ['Conseil', 'I', 'you', 'sir', 'I'], ['Conseil', 'I', 'you', 'sir', 'I']. And, must ['Conseil', 'I', 'you', 'sir', 'I'] say ['think', 'it']?” 
 
“Go on, my good friend.” 
 
“Well, ['sir', 'you', 'your'], ['sir', 'you', 'your'] will only get ['sir', 'you', 'your'] deserts.” 
 
“Indeed!” 
 
“When one has the honour of being a savant as ['you', 'sir'] are, ['you', 'sir'], one should not expose one’s self to——” 
 
['Conseil', 'his'] had not time to finish ['Conseil', 'his'] compliment. In the midst of general silence ['a voice', 'It'] had just been heard. ['a voice', 'It'] was the voice of Ned Land shouting— 
 
“Look out there! The very thing ['we', 'our'] are looking for—on ['we', 'our'] weather beam!” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER VI AT FULL STEAM 
 
At this cry the whole ship’s crew hurried towards the harpooner,—commander, officers, masters, sailors, cabin boys; ['even the engineers', 'their', 'their'] left ['even the engineers', 'their', 'their'] engines, and the stokers ['even the engineers', 'their', 'their'] furnaces. 
 
The order to stop ['her', 'the frigate', 'her'] had been given, and ['her', 'the frigate', 'her'] now simply went on by ['her', 'the frigate', 'her'] own momentum. The darkness was then profound, and however good ['the Canadian’s', 'he', 'he', 'Ned Land', 'he'] eyes were, ['I', 'myself', 'My'] asked ['I', 'myself', 'My'] how ['the Canadian’s', 'he', 'he', 'Ned Land', 'he'] had managed to see, and what ['the Canadian’s', 'he', 'he', 'Ned Land', 'he'] had been able to see. ['I', 'myself', 'My['My heart', 'it'] beat as if ['My heart', 'it'] would break. But ['the Canadian’s', 'he', 'he', 'Ned Land', 'he'] was not mistaken, and we all perceived ['the object he pointed to', '['the Canadian’s', 'he', 'he', 'Ned Land', 'he']e monster']. At two cables’ length from the _Abraham Lincoln_, on the starboard quarter, ['the sea', 'the sea'] seemed to be ['illuminated', 'It', 'This magnificent irradiation'] all over. ['illuminated', 'It', 'This magnificent irradiation'] was not a mere phosphoric phenomenon. ['the object he pointed to', 'The monster'] emerged some fathoms from the water, and then threw out that very intense but inexplicable light mentioned in the report of several captains. ['illuminated', 'It', 'This magnificent irradiation'] must have been produced by an agent of great _shining_ power. The luminous part traced on ['the sea', 'the sea'] an immense oval, much elongated, the centre of which condensed a burning heat, whose overpowering brilliancy died out by successive gradations. 
 
“It is only an agglomeration of phosphoric particles,” cried one of the officers. 
 
“No, sir, certainly not,” I replied. “Never did pholades or salpæ produce such a powerful light. ['That brightness', 'it', 'it', 'it'] is of an essentially electrical nature. Besides, see, see! ['That brightness', 'it', 'it', 'it'] moves; ['That brightness', 'it', 'it', 'it'] is moving forwards, backwards; ['That brightness', 'it', 'it', 'it'] is darting towards us!” 
 
A general cry rose from the frigate. 
 
“Silence!” said the Captain; “up with the helm, reverse the engines.” 
 
The steam was shut off, and the _Abraham Lincoln_, beating to port, described a semicircle. 
 
“Right the helm, go ahead,” cried the Captain. 
 
These orders were executed, and the frigate moved rapidly from the burning light. 
 
I was mistaken. She tried to sheer off, but ['the supernatural animal', 'her'] approached with a velocity double ['the supernatural animal', 'her'] own. 
 
['We', 'us', 'us', 'us'] gasped for breath. Stupefaction more than fear made ['We', 'us', 'us', 'us'] dumb and motionless. ['The animal', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'the monster', 'its', 'it', 'it'] gained on ['We', 'us', 'us', 'us'], sporting with the waves. ['The animal', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'the monster', 'its', 'it', 'it'] made the round of ['the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots', 'it', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the vessel', 'the frigate'], and enveloped ['the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots', 'it', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the vessel', 'the frigate'] with ['The animal', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'the monster', 'its', 'it', 'it'] electric rings like luminous dust. Then ['The animal', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'the monster', 'its', 'it', 'it'] moved away two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent track, like those volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind. All at once from the dark line of the horizon whither ['The animal', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'the monster', 'its', 'it', 'it'] retired to gain ['The animal', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'the monster', 'its', 'it', 'it'] momentum, ['The animal', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'the monster', 'its', 'it', 'it'] rushed suddenly towards ['the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots', 'it', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the vessel', 'the frigate'] with alarming rapidity, stopped suddenly about twenty feet from ['the hull', 'the hull'], and died out,—not diving under the water, for ['The animal', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'the monster', 'its', 'it', 'it'] brilliancy did not abate,—but suddenly, and as if the source of this brilliant emanation was exhausted. Then ['The animal', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'the monster', 'its', 'it', 'it'] reappeared on the other side of ['the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots', 'it', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the vessel', 'the frigate'], as if ['The animal', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'the monster', 'its', 'it', 'it'] had turned and slid under ['the hull', 'the hull']. Any moment a collision might have occurred which would have been fatal to ['We', 'us', 'us', 'us']. However, I was astonished at ['the manœuvres of the friga['the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots', 'it', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'the vessel', 'the frigate']. ['the manœuvres of the frigate', 'She'] fled and did not attack. 
 
On the captain’s face, generally so impassive, was an expression of unaccountable astonishment. 
 
“Mr. Aronnax,” ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] said, “['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] do not know with what formidable being ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] have to deal, and ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] will not imprudently risk ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] frigate in the midst of this darkness. Besides, how attack ['this unknown thing', 'it'], how defend one’s self from ['this unknown thing', 'it']? Wait for daylight, and the scene will change.” 
 
“['You', 'captain'] have no further doubt, ['You', 'captain'], of the nature of the animal?” 
 
“No, sir; it is evidently a gigantic narwhal, and an electric one.” 
 
“Perhaps,” added I, “one can only approach it with a gymnotus or a torpedo.” 
 
“Undoubtedly,” replied ['the captain', 'I', 'my'], “if ['it', 'it'] possesses such dreadful power, ['it', 'it'] is the most terrible animal that ever was created. That is why, sir, ['the captain', 'I', 'my'] must be on ['the captain', 'I', 'my'] guard.” 
 
['The crew', 'their'] were on ['The crew', 'their'] feet all night. No one thought of sleep. ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'the frigate', 'it'], not being able to struggle with such velocity, had moderated ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'the frigate', 'it'] pace, and sailed at half speed. For ['its', 'the narwhal', 'it', 'it', 'it'] part, ['its', 'the narwhal', 'it', 'it', 'it'], imitating ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'the frigate', 'it'], let the waves rock ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'the frigate', 'it'] at will, and seemed decided not to leave the scene of the struggle. Towards midnight, however, ['its', 'the narwhal', 'it', 'it', 'it'] disappeared, or, to use a more appropriate term, ['its', 'the narwhal', 'it', 'it', 'it'] “died out” like a large glow-worm. Had ['its', 'the narwhal', 'it', 'it', 'it'] fled? One could only fear, not hope. But at seven minutes to one o’clock in the morning a deafening whistling was heard, like that produced by a body of water rushing with great violence. 
 
The captain, Ned Land, and I, were then on the poop, eagerly peering through the profound darkness. 
 
“Ned Land,” asked ['the commander', 'you'], “['the commander', 'you'] have often heard the roaring of whales?” 
 
“Often, sir; but never ['such whales the sight of which brought me in tw['me', 'I']thousand dollars', 'it']. If ['me', 'I'] can only approach within four harpoon lengths of ['such whales the sight of which brought me in two thousand dollars', 'it']!” 
 
“But to approach it,” said ['the commander', 'I'], “['the commander', 'I'] ought to put a whaler at your disposal?” 
 
“Certainly, sir.” 
 
“That will be trifling with the lives of my men.” 
 
“And mine too,” simply said the harpooner. 
 
Towards two o’clock in the morning, the burning light reappeared, not less intense, about five miles to windward of the _Abraham Lincoln_. Notwithstanding the distance, and the noise of the wind and sea, one heard distinctly the loud strokes of ['the animal’s', 'its', 'the enormous narwhal', 'its'] tail, and even ['the animal’s', 'its', 'the enormous narwhal', 'its'] panting breath. It seemed that, at the moment that ['the animal’s', 'its', 'the enormous narwhal', 'its'] had come to take breath at the surface of the water, the air was engulfed in ['the animal’s', 'its', 'the enormous narwhal', 'its'] lungs, like the steam in the vast cylinders of a machine of two thousand horse-power. 
 
“Hum!” thought I, “a whale with the strength of a cavalry regiment would be a pretty whale!” 
 
We were on the _qui vive_ till daylight, and prepared for the combat. The fishing implements were laid along the hammock nettings. The second lieutenant loaded the blunderbusses, which could throw harpoons to the distance of a mile, and long duck-guns, with explosive bullets, which inflicted mortal wounds even to the most terrible animals. ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'his', 'his'] contented ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'his', 'his'] with sharpening ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'his', 'his'] harpoon—a terrible weapon in ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'his', 'his'] hands. 
 
At six o’clock ['day', 'the day'] began to break; and, with the first glimmer of light, the electric light of the narwhal disappeared. At seven o’clock ['day', 'the day'] was sufficiently advanced, but ['a very thick sea fog', 'it'] obscured our view, and the best spy-glasses could not pierce ['a very thick sea fog', 'it']. That caused disappointment and anger. 
 
I climbed the mizzen-mast. Some officers were already perched on the mast heads. At eight o’clock ['the fog', 'its'] lay heavily on the waves, and ['the fog', 'its'] thick scrolls rose little by little. The horizon grew wider and clearer at the same time. Suddenly, just as on the day before, Ned Land’s voice was heard: 
 
“The thing itself on the port quarter!” cried the harpooner. 
 
Every eye was turned towards the point indicated. There, a mile and a half from the frigate, ['a long blackish body', 'Its', 'the animal'] emerged a yard above the waves. ['a long blackish body', 'Its', 'the animal'] tail, violently agitated, produced a considerable eddy. Never did a caudal appendage beat the sea with such violence. An immense track, of dazzling whiteness, marked the passage of ['a long blackish body', 'Its', 'the animal'], and described a long curve. 
 
The frigate approached ['the cetacean', 'it']. I examined ['the cetacean', 'it'] thoroughly. 
 
The reports of ['the _Shannon_', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'it'] and of the _Helvetia_ had rather exaggerated ['the _Shannon_', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'it'] size, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] estimated ['the _Shannon_', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'it'] length at only two hundred and fifty feet. As to ['the _Shannon_', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'i['its dimensions', 'them'], ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could only conjecture ['its dimensions', 'them'] to be admirably proportioned. While ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] watched this phenomenon, two jets of steam and water were ejected from ['the _Shannon_', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'it'] vents, and rose to the height of 120 feet; thus ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] ascertained ['the _Shannon_', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'it'] way of breathing. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] concluded definitely that ['the _Shannon_', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'it'] belonged to the vertebrate branch, class mammalia. 
 
['The crew', 'their'] waited impatiently for ['The crew', 'th['their chief’s', 'The latter'] orders. ['their chief’s', 'The latter'], after having observed the animal attentively, called ['the engineer', 'The engineer', 'him']. ['the engineer', 'The engineer', 'him'] ran to ['the engineer', 'The engineer', 'him']. 
 
“['Sir', 'you'],” said the commander, “['Sir', 'you'] have steam up?” 
 
“Yes, sir,” answered the engineer. 
 
“Well, make up your fires and put on all steam.” 
 
Three hurrahs greeted this order. The time for the struggle had arrived. Some moments after, the two funnels of the frigate vomited torrents of black smoke, and the bridge quaked under the trembling of the boilers. 
 
['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'The latter', 'it', 'it'], propelled by ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'The latter', 'it', 'it'] wonderful screw, went straight at the animal. ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'The latter', 'it', 'it'] allowed ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'The latter', 'it', 'it'] to come within half a cable’s length; then, as if disdaining to dive, ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'her', 'The latter', 'it', 'it'] took a little turn, and stopped a short distance off. 
 
This pursuit lasted nearly three-quarters of an hour, without the frigate gaining two yards on the cetacean. It was quite evident that at that rate we should never come up with it. 
 
“Well, Mr. Land,” asked ['the captain', 'you', 'me'], “do ['the captain', 'you', 'me'] advise ['the captain', 'you', 'me'] to put the boats out to sea?” 
 
“No, sir,” replied Ned Land; “because we shall not take that beast easily.” 
 
“What shall we do then?” 
 
“Put on more steam if ['you', 'sir', 'your'] can, ['you', 'sir', 'your']. With ['you', 'sir', 'your'] leave, ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] mean to post ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] under the bowsprit, and if we get within harpooning distance, ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] shall throw ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] harpoon.” 
 
“Go, Ned,” said the captain. “Engineer, put on more pressure.” 
 
['Ned Land', 'his'] went to ['Ned Land', 'his'] post. The fires were increased, the screw revolved forty-three times a minute, and the steam poured out of the valves. We heaved the log, and calculated that the _Abraham Lincoln_ was going at the rate of 18½ miles an hour. 
 
But the accursed animal swam too at the rate of 18½ miles an hour. 
 
For a whole hour, ['the frigate', 'one of the swiftest sailers in the American navy'] ['kept', 'It'] up this pace, without gaining six feet. ['kept', 'It'] was humiliating for ['the frigate', 'one of the swiftest sailers in the American navy']. A stubborn anger seized ['the crew', 'the sailors', 'them']; ['the crew', 'the sailors', 'them'] abused the monster, who, as before, disdained to answer ['the crew', 'the sailors', 'them']; ['the captain', 'himself', 'his', 'he'] no longer contented ['the captain', 'himself', 'his', 'he'] with twisting ['the captain', 'himself', 'his', 'h['his beard', 'it']—['the captain', 'himself', 'his', 'he'] gnawed ['his beard', 'it']. 
 
The engineer was again called. 
 
“You have turned full steam in?” 
 
“Yes, sir,” replied the engineer. 
 
The speed of ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'Its'] increased. ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'It['Its masts', 'their'] trembled down to ['Its masts', 'their'] stepping holes, and the clouds of smoke could hardly find way out of the narrow funnels. 
 
They heaved the log a second time. 
 
“Well?” asked the captain of the man at the wheel. 
 
“Nineteen miles and three-tenths, sir.” 
 
“Clap on more steam.” 
 
The engineer obeyed. The manometer showed ten degrees. But ['the cetacean', 'itself', 'itself', 'it'] grew warm ['the cetacean', 'itself', 'itself', 'it'], no doubt; for without straining ['the cetacean', 'itself', 'itself', 'it'], ['the cetacean', 'itself', 'itself', 'it'] made 19-3/10 miles. 
 
What a pursuit! No, ['I', 'me'] cannot describe the emotion that vibrated through ['I', 'me']. ['Ned Land', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'he'] kept ['Ned Land', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'he'] post, harpoon in hand. Several times ['the animal', 'it', 'it', 'the cetacean', 'it'] let ['us', 'we', 'our'] gain upon it.—“We shall catch ['the animal', 'it', 'it', 'the cetacean', 'it']! ['us', 'we', 'our'] shall catch ['the animal', 'it', 'it', 'the cetacean', 'it']!” cried ['Ned Land', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'he']. But just as ['Ned Land', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'he'] was going to strike, ['the animal', 'it', 'it', 'the cetacean', 'it'] stole away with a rapidity that could not be estimated at less than thirty miles an hour, and even during ['us', 'we', 'our'] maximum of speed, ['the animal', 'it', 'it', 'the cetacean', 'it'] bullied ['the frigate', 'it'], going round and round ['the frigate', 'it']. A cry of fury broke from everyone! 
 
At noon we were no further advanced than at eight o’clock in the morning. 
 
The captain then decided to take more direct means. 
 
“Ah!” said he, “['that animal', 'it'] goes quicker than the _Abraham Lincoln_. Very well! we will see whether ['that animal', 'it'] will escape these conical bullets. Send ['your', 'sir'] men to the forecastle, ['your', 'sir'].” 
 
The forecastle gun was immediately loaded and slewed round. But the shot passed some feet above the cetacean, which was half a mile off. 
 
“Another, more to the right,” cried the commander, “and five dollars to whoever will hit that infernal beast.” 
 
An old gunner with a grey beard—that I can see now—with steady eye and grave face, went up to the gun and took a long aim. A loud report was heard, with which were mingled the cheers of the crew. 
 
[Illustration] An old grey-bearded gunner . . . . 
 
['The bullet', 'its', 'it'] did ['The bullet', 'its', 'it'] work; ['The bullet', 'its', 'it'] hit the animal, but not fatally, and sliding off the rounded surface, was lost in two miles depth of sea. 
 
The chase began again, and the captain, leaning towards me, said— 
 
“['I', 'my'] will pursue that beast till ['I', 'my'] frigate bursts up.” 
 
“Yes,” answered I; “and you will be quite right to do it.” 
 
I wished ['the beast', 'itself', 'it', 'its'] would exhaust ['the beast', 'itself', 'it', 'its'], and not be insensible to fatigue like a steam engine! But ['the beast', 'itself', 'it', 'its'] was of no use. Hours passed, without ['the beast', 'itself', 'it', 'its'] showing any signs of exhaustion. 
 
However, it must be said in praise of ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'she'], that ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'she'] struggled on indefatigably. I cannot reckon the distance ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'she'] made under three hundred miles during this unlucky day, November the 6th. But night came on, and overshadowed the rough ocean. 
 
Now ['I', 'I'] thought ['our', 'we'] expedition was at an end, and that ['our', 'we'] should never again see the extraordinary animal. ['I', 'I'] was mistaken. At ten minutes to eleven in the evening, the electric light reappeared three miles to windward of the frigate, as pure, as intense as during the preceding night. 
 
['The narwhal', 'its', 'it', 'itself'] seemed motionless; perhaps, tired with ['The narwhal', 'its', 'it', 'itself'] day’s work, ['The narwhal', 'its', 'it', 'itself'] slept, letting ['The narwhal', 'its', 'it', 'itself'] float with the undulation of the waves. Now was a chance of which the captain resolved to take advantage. 
 
['He', 'his'] gave ['He', 'his'] orders. ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'its adversary', 'Ned Land', 'its', 'The Canadian', 'his'] kept up half steam, and advanced cautiously so as not to awake ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'its adversary', 'Ned Land', 'its', 'The Canadian', 'hi['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'its adversary', 'Ned Land', 'its', 'The Canadian', 'his']. It is no rare thing to meet in the middle of the ocean ['whales so sound asleep that they can b['whales so sound asleep that they can be successfully attacked', 'they']ccessfully attacked', 'they'], and ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'its adversary', 'Ned Land', 'its', 'The Canadian', 'his'] had harpooned more than one during ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'its adversary', 'Ned Land', 'its', 'The Canadian', 'his'] sleep. ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'its adversary', 'Ned Land', 'its', 'The Canadian', 'his'] went to take ['The _Abraham Lincoln_', 'its', 'its adversary', 'Ned Land', 'its', 'The Canadian', 'his'] place again under the bowsprit. 
 
['The frigate', 'the animal', 'its'] approached noiselessly, stopped at two cables’ lengths from ['The frigate', 'the animal', 'its'], and following ['The frigate', 'the animal', 'its'] track. No one breathed; a deep silence reigned on the bridge. ['We', 'our'] were not a hundred feet from the burning focus, the light of which increased and dazzled ['We', 'our'] eyes. 
 
At this moment, leaning on the forecastle bulwark, ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] saw below ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his'] grappling ['the martingale', 'the motionless animal', 'the frigate'] in one hand, brandishing ['Ned Land', 'his', 'hi['his terrible harpoon', 'the harpoon', 'the weapon, which seemed to have struck a hard body'] in the other, scarcely twenty feet from ['the martingale', 'the motionless animal', 'the frigate']. Suddenly ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his'] arm straightened, and ['his terrible harpoon', 'the harpoon', 'the weapon, which seemed to have struck a hard body'] was thrown; ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] heard the sonorous stroke of ['his terrible harpoon', 'the harpoon', 'the weapon, which seemed to have struck a hard body']. The electric light went out suddenly, and two enormous waterspouts broke over the bridge of ['the martingale', 'the motionless animal', 'the frigate'], rushing like a torrent from stem to stern, overthrowing men, and breaking the lashings of the spars. A fearful shock followed, and, thrown over the rail without having time to stop ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I'], ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] fell into the sea. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER VII AN UNKNOWN SPECIES OF WHALE 
 
['This unexpected fall', 'that plunge'] so stunned ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I'] that ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I'] have no clear recollection of ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I'] sensations at the time. ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I'] was at first drawn down to a depth of about twenty feet. ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I'] am a good swimmer (though without pretending to rival Byron or Edgar Poe, who were masters of the art), and in ['This unexpected fall', 'that plunge'] ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I'] did not lose ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I'] presence of mind. Two vigorous strokes brought ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I'] to the surface of the water. ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I'] first care was to look for ['the frigate', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_']. Had the crew seen ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I'] disappear? Had ['the frigate', 'the _Abraham Lincoln_'] veered round? Would the captain put out a boat? Might ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I'] hope to be saved? 
 
The darkness was intense. ['I', 'I'] caught a glimpse of ['a black mass disappearing in the east', 'its', 'It'], ['a black mass disappearing in the east', 'its', 'It'] beacon lights dying out in the distance. ['a black mass disappearing in the east', 'its', 'It'] was the frigate! ['I', 'I'] was lost. 
 
“Help, help!” I shouted, swimming towards the _Abraham Lincoln_ in desperation. 
 
['My', 'me', 'my', 'my'] clothes encumbered ['My', 'me', 'my', 'my']; they seemed glued to ['My', 'me', 'my', 'my'] body, and paralysed ['My', 'me', 'my', 'my'] movements. 
 
['I', 'I'] was sinking! ['I', 'I'] was suffocating! 
 
“Help!” 
 
This was ['my', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my'] last cry. ['my', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my'] mouth filled with water; ['my', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my'] struggled against being drawn down the abyss. Suddenly ['my', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my'] clothes were seized by a strong hand, and ['my', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my'] felt ['my', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my'] quickly drawn up to the surface of the sea; and ['my', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my'] heard, yes, ['my', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my'] heard these words pronounced in ['my', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my'] ear— 
 
“If ['master', 'master'] would be so good as to lean on my shoulder, ['master', 'master'] would swim with much greater ease.” 
 
['I', 'my'] seized with one hand ['I', 'my'] faithful Conseil’s arm. 
 
“Is it ['you', 'I']?” said ['you', 'I'], “you?” 
 
“['Myself', 'Conseil'],” answered ['Myself', 'Conseil']; “and waiting master’s orders.” 
 
“That shock threw you as well as me into the sea?” 
 
“No; but being in ['my', 'I['my master’s', 'him'] service, ['my', 'I'] followed ['my master’s', 'him'].” 
 
The worthy fellow thought that was but natural. 
 
“And the frigate?” I asked. 
 
“['The frigate', 'her']?” replied ['Conseil', 'his', 'I'], turning on ['Conseil', 'his', 'I'] back; “['Conseil', 'his', 'I'] think that master had better not count too much on ['The frigate', 'her'].” 
 
“You think so?” 
 
“['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] say that, at the time ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] threw ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] into the sea, ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] heard the men at the wheel say, ‘The screw and the rudder are broken.’” 
 
“Broken?” 
 
“Yes, ['broken', 'It', 'it'] by the monster’s teeth. ['broken', 'It', 'it'] is the only injury ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'her'] has sustained. But ['broken', 'It', 'it'] is a bad look out for us—['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'her'] no longer answers ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'she', 'her'] helm.” 
 
“Then we are lost!” 
 
“Perhaps so,” calmly answered Conseil. “However, ['we', 'us'] have still several hours before ['we', 'us'], and one can do a good deal in some hours.” 
 
['Conseil’s', 'Conseil'] imperturbable coolness set ['me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] up again. ['me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] swam more vigorously; but, cramped by ['me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] clothes, which stuck to ['me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] like a leaden weight, ['me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] ['felt', 'this'] great difficulty in bearing up. ['Conseil’s', 'Conseil'] saw ['felt', 'this']. 
 
“Will master let ['me', 'he', 'my', 'he', 'he', 'me', 'I'] make a slit?” said ['me', 'he', 'my', 'he', 'he', 'me', 'I']; and, slipping an open knife under ['me', 'he', 'my', 'he', 'he', 'me', 'I['my clothes', 'them', 'them'], ['me', 'he', 'my', 'he', 'he', 'me', 'I'] ripped ['my clothes', 'them', 'them'] up from top to bottom very rapidly. Then ['me', 'he', 'my', 'he', 'he', 'me', 'I'] cleverly slipped ['my clothes', 'them', 'them'] off ['me', 'he', 'my', 'he', 'he', 'me', 'I'], while ['me', 'he', 'my', 'he', 'he', 'me', 'I'] swam for ['both of us', 'us['both of us', 'us']. 
 
Then I did the same for Conseil, and we continued to swim near to each other. 
 
Nevertheless, ['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'us'] situation was no less terrible. Perhaps ['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'u['our disappearance', 'it'] had not been noticed; and if ['our disappearance', 'it'] had been, ['the frigate', 'its'] could not tack, being without ['the frigate', 'its'] helm. ['Conseil', 'his', 'This phlegmatic boy'] argued on this supposition, and laid ['Conseil', 'his', 'This phlegmatic boy'] plans accordingly. ['Conseil', 'his', 'This phlegmatic boy'] was perfectly self-possessed. ['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'us'] then decided that, as ['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'us'] only chance of safety was being picked up by ['the _Abraham Lincoln’s_ boats', 'them'], ['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'us'] ought to manage so as to wait for ['the _Abraham Lincoln’s_ boats', 'them'] as long as possible. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] resolved then to husband ['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'us'] strength, so that both should not be exhausted at the same time; and this is how ['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'us'] managed: while one of ['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'us'] lay on ['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'us'] back, quite still, with arms crossed, and legs stretched out, the other would swim and push the other on in front. This towing business did not last more than ten minutes each; and relieving each other thus, ['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'us'] could swim on for some hours, perhaps till daybreak. Poor chance! but hope is so firmly rooted in the heart of man! Moreover, there were ['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'us['our', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'two of us', 'us']. Indeed ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] declare (though it may seem improbable) if ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] sought to destroy all hope,—if ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] wished to despair, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could not. 
 
The collision of the frigate with the cetacean had occurred about eleven o’clock the evening before. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] reckoned then ['we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'we'] should have eight hours to ['swim', 'an operation quite practicable if we relieved each other'] before sunrise, ['swim', 'an operation quite practicable if we['we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'we']elieved each other']. The sea, very calm, was in ['we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'we'] favour. Sometimes ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] tried to pierce the intense darkness that was only dispelled by the phosphorescence caused by ['we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'we'] movements. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] watched the luminous waves that broke over ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] hand, whose mirror-like surface was spotted with silvery rings. One might have said that ['we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'we'] were in a bath of quicksilver. 
 
Near one o’clock in the morning, ['I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I'] was seized with dreadful fatigue. ['I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I'] limbs stiffened under the strain of violent cramp. Conseil was obliged to keep ['I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I'] up, and our preservation devolved on him alone. ['I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I'] heard ['the poor boy', 'his', 'he'] pant; ['the poor boy', 'his', 'he'] breathing became short and hurried. ['I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I'] found that ['the poor boy', 'his', 'he'] could not keep up much longer. 
 
“Leave ['me', 'me', 'I']! leave ['me', 'me', 'I']!” ['me', 'me', 'I'] said to him. 
 
“Leave ['my', 'he', 'I'] master? Never!” replied ['my', 'he', 'I']. “['my', 'he', 'I'] would drown first.” 
 
Just then the moon appeared through the fringes of a thick cloud that the wind was driving to the east. The surface of ['the sea', 'its'] glittered with ['the sea', 'it['its rays', 'This kindly light']. ['its rays', 'This kindly light'] reanimated ['us', 'us']. ['My', 'I', 'I'] head got better again. ['My', 'I', 'I'] looked at all points of the horizon. ['My', 'I', 'I'] saw ['the frigate', 'She']! ['the frigate', 'She'] was five miles from ['us', 'us'], and looked like a dark mass, hardly discernible. But no boats! 
 
['I', 'My', 'I'] would have cried out. But what good would it have been at such a distance! ['I', 'My', 'I'] swollen lips could utter no sounds. ['Conseil', 'him'] could articulate some words, and ['I', 'My', 'I'] heard ['Conseil', 'him'] repeat at intervals, “Help! help!” 
 
['Our', 'we'] movements were suspended for an instant; ['Our', 'we'] listened. It might be only a singing in the ear, but it seemed to me as if a cry answered the cry from Conseil. 
 
“Did you hear?” I murmured. 
 
“Yes! Yes!” 
 
And Conseil gave one more despairing call. 
 
This time there was no mistake! ['A human voice', 'it', 'it'] responded to ['ours', 'us']! Was ['A human voice', 'it', 'it'] the voice of another unfortunate creature, abandoned in the middle of the ocean, some other victim of the shock sustained by the vessel? Or rather was ['A human voice', 'it', 'it'] a boat from the frigate, that was hailing ['ours', 'us'] in the darkness? 
 
['Conseil', 'he', 'himself'] made a last effort, and, leaning on ['my', 'I'] shoulder, while ['my', 'I'] struck out in a despairing effort, ['Conseil', 'he', 'himself'] raised ['Conseil', 'he', 'himself'] half out of the water, then fell back exhausted. 
 
“What did you see?” 
 
“['I', 'he', 'I', 'your'] saw”—murmured ['I', 'he', 'I', 'your']; “['I', 'he', 'I', 'your'] saw—but do not talk—reserve all ['I', 'he', 'I', 'your'] strength!” 
 
What had he seen? Then, ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] know not why, the thought of the monster came into ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I['my head', 'my head'] for the first time! But ['that voice', 'a voice that came nearer and nearer', 'it']! The time is past for Jonahs to take refuge in whales’ bellies! However, ['Conseil', 'He', 'his'] was towing ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] again. ['Conseil', 'He', 'his'] raised ['Conseil', 'He', 'his'] head sometimes, looked before us, and uttered a cry of recognition, which was responded to by ['that voice', 'a voice that came nearer and nearer', 'it']. ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] scarcely heard ['that voice', 'a voice that came nearer and nearer', 'it']. ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] strength was exhausted; ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] fingers stiffened; ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] hand afforded ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] support no longer; ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] mouth, convulsively opening, filled with salt water. Cold crept over ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I']. ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] raised ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I['my head', 'my head'] for the last time, then ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] sank. 
 
At this moment ['a hard body', 'it'] struck ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my']. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] clung to ['a hard body', 'it']: then ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] felt that ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] was being drawn up, that ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] was brought to the surface of the water, that ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] chest collapsed:—I fainted. 
 
It is certain that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] soon came to, thanks to the vigorous rubbings that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] received. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] half opened ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] eyes. 
 
“Conseil!” I murmured. 
 
“Does master call ['me', 'Conseil']?” asked ['me', 'Conseil']. 
 
Just then, by the waning light of the moon which was sinking down to the horizon, ['I', 'I'] saw a face which was not Conseil’s and which ['I', 'I'] immediately recognised. 
 
“Ned!” I cried. 
 
“The same, sir, who is seeking his prize!” replied the Canadian. 
 
“Were you thrown into the sea by the shock to the frigate?” 
 
“Yes, ['Professor', 'you']; but more fortunate than ['Professor', 'you'], I was able to find a footing almost directly upon a floating island.” 
 
“An island?” 
 
“Or, more correctly speaking, on our gigantic narwhal.” 
 
“Explain ['yourself', 'Ned'], ['yourself', 'Ned']!” 
 
“Only ['I', 'my'] soon found out why ['I', 'my['my harpoon', 'its'] had not entered ['my harpoon', 'its'] skin and was blunted.” 
 
“Why, Ned, why?” 
 
“Because, Professor, that beast is made of sheet iron.” 
 
The Canadian’s last words produced a sudden revolution in ['my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] brain. ['my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] wriggled ['my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] quickly to the top of ['the being, or object, half out of the water, which served us for a refuge', 'it', 'It', 'this hard body', 'this monster']. ['my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] kicked ['the being, or object, half out of the water, which served us for a refuge', 'it', 'It', 'this hard body', 'this monster']. ['the being, or object, half out of the water, which served us for a refuge', 'it', 'It', 'this hard body', 'this monster'] was evidently a hard impenetrable body, and not the soft substance that forms the bodies of the great marine mammalia. But ['the being, or object, half out of the water, which served us for a refuge', 'it', 'It', 'this hard body', 'this monster'] might be a bony carapace, like that of the antediluvian animals; and ['my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] should be free to class ['the being, or object, half out of the water, which served us for a refuge', 'it', 'It', 'this hard body', 'this monster'] among amphibious reptiles, such as tortoises or alligators. 
 
Well, no! the blackish back that supported ['me', 'I'] was smooth, polished, without scales. The blow produced ['a metallic sound', 'it', 'it']; and incredible though ['a metallic sound', 'it', 'it'] may be, it seemed, ['me', 'I'] might say, as if ['a metallic sound', 'it', 'it'] was made of riveted plates. 
 
There was no doubt about it! ['This monster, this natural phenomenon that had puzzled the learned world, and overthrown and misled the imagination of seamen of both hemispheres', 'it', 'it'], ['This monster, this natural phenomenon that had puzzled the learned world, and overthrown and misled the imagination of seamen of both hemispheres', 'it', 'it'] must be owned, a still more astonishing phenomenon, inasmuch as ['This monster, this natural phenomenon that had puzzled the learned world, and overthrown and misled the imagination of seamen of both hemispheres', 'it', 'it'] was a simply human construction. 
 
['We', 'We'] had no time to lose, however. ['We', 'We'] were lying upon the back of a sort of submarine boat, which appeared (as far as ['I', 'I'] could judge) like a huge fish of steel. ['Ned Land’s', 'him'] mind was made up on this point. Conseil and ['I', 'I'] could only agree with ['Ned Land’s', 'him']. 
 
Just then a bubbling began at the back of ['this strange thing (which was evidently propelled by a screw)', 'it', 'its'], and ['this strange thing (which was evidently propelled by a screw)', 'it', 'its'] began to move. We had only just time to seize hold of the upper part, which rose about seven feet out of the water, and happily ['this strange thing (which was evidently propelled by a screw)', 'it', 'its'] speed was not great. 
 
“As long as ['it', 'it'] sails horizontally,” muttered ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I', 'my'], “['Ned Land', 'I', 'I', 'my'] do not mind; but if ['it', 'it'] takes a fancy to dive, ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I', 'my'] would not give two straws for ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I', 'my'] life.” 
 
The Canadian might have said still less. It became really necessary to communicate with ['the beings', 'they'], whatever ['the beings', 'they'] were, shut up inside the machine. I searched all over the outside for an aperture, a panel, or a man-hole, to use a technical expression; but the lines of the iron rivets, solidly driven into the joints of the iron plates, were clear and uniform. Besides, the moon disappeared then, and left us in total darkness. 
 
At last ['this long night', 'it'] passed. ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] indistinct remembrance prevents ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] describing all the impressions ['this long night', 'it'] made. ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] can only recall one circumstance. During some lulls of the wind and sea, ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] fancied ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] heard several times vague sounds, a sort of fugitive harmony produced by words of command. What was then the mystery of ['this submarine craft, of which the whole world vainly sought an explanation', 'this strange boat', 'its']? What kind of beings existed in ['this submarine craft, of which the whole world vainly sought an explanation', 'this strange boat', 'its']? What mechanical agent caused ['this submarine craft, of which the whole world vainly sought an explanation', 'this strange boat', 'its'] prodigious speed? 
 
Daybreak appeared. ['The morning mists', 'they'] surrounded us, but ['The morning mists', 'they'] soon cleared off. ['I', 'I'] was about to examine ['the hull, which formed on deck a kind of horizontal platform', 'it'], when ['I', 'I'] felt ['the hull, which formed on deck a kind of horizontal platform', 'it'] gradually sinking. 
 
“Oh! confound it!” cried Ned Land, kicking the resounding plate. “Open, you inhospitable rascals!” 
 
Happily the sinking movement ceased. Suddenly a noise, like iron works violently pushed aside, came from the interior of the boat. One iron plate was moved, a man appeared, uttered an odd cry, and disappeared immediately. 
 
Some moments after, ['eight strong men, with masked faces', 'their'], appeared noiselessly, and drew us down into ['eight strong men, with masked faces', 'their'] formidable machine. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER VIII MOBILIS IN MOBILI 
 
This forcible abduction, so roughly carried out, was accomplished with the rapidity of lightning. I shivered all over. Whom had we to deal with? No doubt ['some new sort of pirates, who explored the sea in their own w['some new sort of pirates, who explored the sea in their own way', 'their']'their']. 
 
Hardly had the narrow panel closed upon ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me'], when ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me'] was enveloped in darkness. ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me'] eyes, dazzled with the outer light, could distinguish nothing. ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me'] felt ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me'] naked feet cling to the rungs of ['an iron ladder', 'the ladder']. ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'us'], firmly seized, followed ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me']. At the bottom of ['an iron ladder', 'the ladder'], a door opened, and shut after ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'us'] immediately with a bang. 
 
We were alone. Where, ['I', 'my'] could not say, hardly imagine. All was black, and such a dense black that, after some minutes, ['I', 'my'] eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer. 
 
Meanwhile, ['Ned Land', 'his'], furious at these proceedings, gave free vent to ['Ned Land', 'his'] indignation. 
 
“Confound it!” cried ['he', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'], “here are ['people who come up to the Scotch for hospitality', 'They', 'they']. ['people who come up to the Scotch for hospitality', 'They', 'they'] only just miss being cannibals. ['he', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] should not be surprised at it, but ['he', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] declare that ['people who come up to the Scotch for hospitality', 'They', 'they'] shall not eat ['he', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] without ['he', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] protesting.” 
 
“Calm ['yourself', 'friend Ned', 'yourself', 'you'], ['yourself', 'friend Ned', 'yourself', 'you'], calm ['yourself', 'friend Ned', 'yourself', 'you'],” replied Conseil, quietly. “Do not cry out before ['yourself', 'friend Ned', 'yourself', 'you'] are hurt. We are not quite done for yet.” 
 
“Not quite,” sharply replied ['the Canadian', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'], “but pretty near, at all events. Things look black. Happily, ['the Canadian', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me['my bowie knife', 'it'] ['the Canadian', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] have still, and ['the Canadian', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] can always see well enough to use ['my bowie knife', 'it']. The first of these pirates who lays a hand on ['the Canadian', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me']——” 
 
“Do not excite ['yourself', 'Ned', 'the harpooner'], ['yourself', 'Ned', 'the harpooner'],” I said to ['yourself', 'Ned', 'the harpooner'], “and do not compromise ['us', 'us', 'us', 'we'] by useless violence. Who knows that they will not listen to ['us', 'us', 'us', 'we']? Let ['us', 'us', 'us', 'we'] rather try to find out where ['us', 'us', 'us', 'we'] are.” 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] groped about. In five steps ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] came to an iron wall, made of plates bolted together. Then turning back ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] struck against a wooden table, near which were ranged several stools. The boards of this prison were concealed under a thick mat of phormium, which deadened the noise of the feet. The bare walls revealed no trace of window or door. Conseil, going round the reverse way, met ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me'], and we went back to the middle of ['the cabin, which measured about twenty feet by ten', 'its']. As to ['the cabin, which measured about twenty feet by ten', 'it['its height', 'it'], ['Ned Land', 'his'], in spite of ['Ned Land', 'his'] own great height, could not measure ['its height', 'it']. 
 
Half an hour had already passed without ['our', 'Our'] situation being bettered, when the dense darkness suddenly gave way to extreme light. ['our', 'Ou['Our prison', 'it'] was suddenly lighted—that is to say, ['Our prison', 'it'] became filled with ['a luminous matter, so strong that I could not bear it at first', 'it', 'its', 'that electric light which played round the submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphoresce['I', 'I', 'my', 'I']ce', 'this lumin['a luminous matter, so strong that I could not bear it at first', 'it', 'its', 'that electric light which played round the submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphorescence', 'this luminous agent']s agent']. In ['a luminous matter, so strong that I could not bear it at first', 'it', 'its', 'that electric light which played round the submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphorescence', 'this luminous agent'] whiteness and intensity ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] recognised ['a luminous matter, so strong that I could not bear it at first', 'it', 'its', 'that electric light which played round the submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphorescence', 'this luminous agent']. After shutting ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I['my eyes', 'them'] involuntarily, ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] opened ['my eyes', 'them'], and saw that ['a luminous matter, so strong that I could not bear it at first', 'it', 'its', 'that electric light which played round the submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphorescence', 'this luminous agent'] came from a half globe, unpolished, placed in the roof of the cabin. 
 
“At last one can see,” cried Ned Land, who, knife in hand, stood on the defensive. 
 
“Yes,” said I; “but ['we', 'ourselves'] are still in the dark about ['we', 'ourselves'].” 
 
“Let master have patience,” said the imperturbable Conseil. 
 
The sudden lighting of ['the cabin', 'it', 'It', 'this boat', 'it', 'it', 'it'] enabled ['me', 'I'] to examine ['the cabin', 'it', 'It', 'this boat', 'it', 'it', 'it'] minutely. ['the cabin', 'it', 'It', 'this boat', 'it', 'it', 'it'] only contained a table and five stools. The invisible door might be hermetically sealed. No noise was heard. All seemed dead in the interior of ['the cabin', 'it', 'It', 'this boat', 'it', 'it', 'it']. Did ['the cabin', 'it', 'It', 'this boat', 'it', 'it', 'it'] move, did ['the cabin', 'it', 'It', 'this boat', 'it', 'it', 'it'] float on the surface of ['the ocean', 'its'], or did ['the cabin', 'it', 'It', 'this boat', 'it', 'it', 'it'] dive into ['the ocean', 'its'] depths? ['me', 'I'] could not guess. 
 
A noise of bolts was now heard, the door opened, and two men appeared. 
 
One was short, very muscular, broad-shouldered, with robust limbs, strong head, an abundance of black hair, thick moustache, a quick penetrating look, and the vivacity which characterises the population of Southern France. 
 
['The second stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] merits a more detailed description. A disciple of Gratiolet or Engel would have read ['The second stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] face like an open book. I made out ['The second stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] prevailing qualities directly:—self-confidence,—because ['The second stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] head was well set on ['The second stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] shoulders, and ['The second stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] black eyes looked around with cold assurance; calmness,—for ['The second stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] skin, rather pale, showed ['The second stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] coolness of blood; energy,—evinced by the rapid contraction of ['The second stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] lofty brows; and courage,—because ['The second stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] deep breathing denoted great power of lungs. 
 
Whether ['this person', 'He', 'This man', 'his'] was thirty-five or fifty years of age, ['I', 'I'] could not say. ['this person', 'He', 'This man', 'his'] was tall, had a large forehead, straight nose, a clearly cut mouth, beautiful teeth, with fine taper hands, indicative of a highly nervous temperament. ['this person', 'He', 'This man', 'his'] was certainly the most admirable specimen ['I', 'I'] had ever met. One particular feature was ['this person', 'He', 'This man', 'his'] eyes, rather far from each other, and which could take in nearly a quarter of the horizon at once. 
 
This faculty—(I verified it later)—gave ['him', 'this stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he'] a range of vision far superior to Ned Land’s. When ['him', 'this stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he'] fixed upon an object, ['him', 'this stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he'] eyebrows met, ['him', 'this stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he'] large eyelids closed around so as to contract the range of ['him', 'this stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he'] vision, and ['him', 'this stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he'] looked as if ['him', 'this stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he'] magnified the objects lessened by distance, as if ['him', 'this stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he'] pierced those sheets of water so opaque to our eyes, and as if ['him', 'this stranger', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he'] read the very depths of the seas. 
 
['The two strangers, with caps made from the fur of the sea otter, and shod with sea boots of seal’s skin', 'the two'], were dressed in clothes of a particular texture, which allowed free movement of the limbs. ['The taller of the two, ['The two strangers, with caps made from the fur of the sea otter, and shod with sea boots of seal’s skin', 'the two']ly the chief on board', 'his'], examined us with great attention, without saying a word; then turning to ['The taller of the two, evidently the chief on board', 'hi['his companion', 'him'], talked with ['his companion', 'him'] in ['an unknown tongue', 'It']. ['an unknown tongue', 'It'] was a sonorous, harmonious, and flexible dialect, the vowels seeming to admit of very varied accentuation. 
 
['The other', 'he'] replied by a shake of the head, and added two or three perfectly incomprehensible words. Then ['The other', 'he'] seemed to question me by a look. 
 
['I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] replied in good French that ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] did not know ['his', 'he'] language; but ['his', 'he'] seemed not to understand ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my'], and ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] situation became more embarrassing. 
 
“If master were to tell our story,” said Conseil, “perhaps these gentlemen may understand some words.” 
 
['I', 'I'] began to tell ['our', 'our'] adventures, articulating each syllable clearly, and without omitting one single detail. ['I', 'I'] announced ['our', 'our'] names and rank, introducing in person ['Professor Aronnax', 'his'], ['Professor Aronnax', 'his'] servant Conseil, and master Ned Land, the harpooner. 
 
['The man with the soft calm eyes', 'his', 'he', 'he'] listened to ['me', 'my', 'I', 'I'] quietly, even politely, and with extreme attention; but nothing in ['The man with the soft calm eyes', 'his', 'he', 'he'] countenance indicated that ['The man with the soft calm eyes', 'his', 'he', 'he'] had understood ['me', 'my', 'I', 'I'] story. When ['me', 'my', 'I', 'I'] finished, ['The man with the soft calm eyes', 'his', 'he', 'he'] said not a word. There remained one resource, to speak ['English', 'this almost universal language', 'it', 'it', 'it']. Perhaps they would know ['English', 'this almost universal language', 'it', 'it', 'it']. ['me', 'my', 'I', 'I'] knew ['English', 'this almost universal language', 'it', 'it', 'it'], as well as the German language,—well enough to read ['English', 'this almost universal language', 'it', 'it', 'it'] fluently, but not to speak ['English', 'this almost universal language', 'it', 'it', 'it'] correctly. But, anyhow, ['we', 'ourselves'] must make ['we', 'ourselves'] understood. 
 
“Go on in ['your', 'the harpooner', 'your'] turn,” ['I', 'I.'] said to ['your', 'the harpooner', 'your']; “speak ['your', 'the harpooner', 'your'] best Anglo-Saxon, and try to do better than ['I', 'I.']” 
 
Ned did not beg off, and recommenced our story. 
 
To ['his', 'the harpooner', 'himself'] great disgust, ['his', 'the harpooner', 'himself'] did not seem to have made ['his', 'the harpooner', 'himself'] more intelligible than I had. ['Our visitors', 'They'] did not stir. ['Our visitors', 'They'] evidently understood neither the language of Arago nor of Faraday. 
 
Very much embarrassed, after having vainly exhausted our speaking resources, I knew not what part to take, when Conseil said— 
 
“If master will permit ['me', 'I'], ['me', 'I'] will relate it in German.” 
 
But in spite of the elegant terms and good accent of the narrator, the German language had no success. At last, nonplussed, ['I', 'my'] tried to remember ['I', 'my'] first lessons, and to narrate our adventures in Latin, but with no better success. This last attempt being of no avail, ['the two strangers', 'their'] exchanged some words in ['the two strangers', 'their'] unknown language, and retired. 
 
The door shut. 
 
“It is an infamous shame,” cried Ned Land, who broke out for the twentieth time. “We speak to ['those rogues', 'them'] in French, English, German, and Latin, and not one of ['those rogues', 'them'] has the politeness to answer!” 
 
“Calm ['yourself', 'the impetuous Ned'],” I said to ['yourself', 'the impetuous Ned'], “anger will do no good.” 
 
“But do ['you', 'Professor', 'our irascible companion'] see, ['you', 'Professor', 'our irascible companion'],” replied ['you', 'Professor', 'our irascible companion'], “that we shall absolutely die of hunger in this iron cage?” 
 
“Bah!” said Conseil, philosophically; “we can hold out some time yet.” 
 
“['My', 'I', 'me'] friends,” ['My', 'I', 'me'] said, “['we', 'We'] must not despair. ['we', 'We'] have been worse off than this. Do ['My', 'I', 'me'] the favour to wait a little before forming an opinion upon the commander and crew of this boat.” 
 
“['My', 'Ned Land'] opinion is formed,” replied ['My', 'Ned Land'], sharply. “They are rascals.” 
 
“Good! and from what country?” 
 
“From the land of rogues!” 
 
“['My', 'I', 'I', 'I'] brave Ned, that country is not clearly indicated on the map of the world; but ['My', 'I', 'I', 'I'] admit that the nationality of ['the two strangers', 'the commander and his companion', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their'] is hard to determine. Neither English, French, nor German, that is quite certain. However, ['My', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am inclined to think that ['the two strangers', 'the commander and his companion', 't['the commander', 'his'], 'th['the commander', 'his'], 'their'] were born in low latitudes. There is southern blood in ['the two strangers', 'the commander and his companion', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their']. But ['My', 'I', 'I', 'I'] cannot decide by ['the two strangers', 'the commander and his companion', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their'] appearance whether ['the two strangers', 'the commander and his companion', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their'] are Spaniards, Turks, Arabians, or Indians. As to ['the two strangers', 'the commander and his companion', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'th['their language', 'it'], ['their language', 'it'] is quite incomprehensible.” 
 
“There is the disadvantage of not knowing all languages,” said Conseil, “or the disadvantage of not having one universal language.” 
 
As ['he', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my'] said these words, the door opened. ['A steward', 'He', 'the steward—dumb, perhaps deaf—'] entered. ['A steward', 'He', 'the steward—dumb, perhaps deaf—'] brought us clothes, coats and trousers, made of a stuff ['he', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my'] did not know. ['he', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my'] hastened to dress ['he', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my'], and ['he', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my'] companions followed ['he', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my'] example. During that time, ['A steward', 'He', 'the steward—dumb, perhaps deaf—']had arranged the table, and laid three plates. 
 
“This is something like,” said Conseil. 
 
“Bah!” said ['the rancorous harpooner', 'you'], “what do ['the rancorous harpooner', 'you'] suppose they eat here? Tortoise liver, filleted shark, and beefsteaks from sea-dogs.” 
 
“We shall see,” said Conseil. 
 
The dishes, of bell metal, were placed on the table, and ['we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'us'] took ['we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'us'] places. Undoubtedly ['we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'us'] had to do with civilised people, and, had it not been for the electric light which flooded ['we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'us'], ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could have fancied ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was in the dining-room of the Adelphi Hotel at Liverpool, or at the Grand Hotel in Paris. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] must say, however, that there was neither bread nor wine. ['The water', 'it'] was fresh and clear, but ['The water', 'it'] was water, and did not suit Ned Land’s taste. Amongst the dishes which were brought to ['we', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'us'], ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] recognised several fish delicately dressed; but of ['some', 'they'], although excellent, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could give no opinion, neither could ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] tell to what kingdom ['some', 'they'] belonged, whether animal or vegetable. As to ['the dinner service', 'it'], ['the dinner service', 'it'] was elegant, and in perfect taste. ['Each utensil, spoon, fork, knife, plate', 'it', 'it'], had a letter engraved on ['Each utensil, spoon, fork, knife, plate', 'it', 'it'], with a motto above ['Each utensil, spoon, fork, knife, plate', 'it', 'it'], of which this is an exact facsimile:— 
 
MOBILIS IN MOBILI N. 
 
The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical person, who commanded at the bottom of the sea. 
 
['Ned and Conseil', 'They'] did not reflect much. ['Ned and Conseil', 'They'] devoured the food, and ['I', 'I'] did likewise. ['I', 'I'] was, besides, reassured as to ['our', 'our', 'us'] fate; and it seemed evident that ['our', 'our', 'us'] hosts would not let ['our', 'our', 'us'] die of want. 
 
However, everything has an end, everything passes away, even the hunger of people who have not eaten for fifteen hours. ['Our', 'we'] appetites satisfied, ['Our', 'we'] felt overcome with sleep. 
 
“Faith! ['I', 'Conseil'] shall sleep well,” said ['I', 'Conseil']. 
 
“So shall ['I', 'Ned Land'],” replied ['I', 'Ned Land']. 
 
['My two companions', 'themsel['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I']s', 'we', 'us'] stretched ['My two companions', 'themselves', 'we', 'us'] on the cabin carpet, and were soon sound asleep. For ['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] own part, too many thoughts crowded ['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] brain, too many insoluble questions pressed upon ['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'], too many fancies kept ['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] eyes half open. Where were ['My two companions', 'themselves', 'we', 'us']? What strange power carried ['My two companions', 'themselves', 'we', 'us'] on? ['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] felt—or rather fancied ['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] felt—['the machine', 'this submarine boat'] sinking down to ['the lowest beds of the sea', 'these mysterious asylums']. Dreadful nightmares beset ['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I']; ['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] saw in ['the lowest beds of the sea', 'these mysterious asylums'] a world of ['unknown animals', 'they'], amongst which ['the machine', 'this submarine boat'] seemed to be of the same kind, living, moving, and formidable as ['unknown animals', 'they']. Then ['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] brain grew calmer, ['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] imagination wandered into vague unconsciousness, and ['My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] soon fell into a deep sleep. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER IX NED LAND’S TEMPERS 
 
How long ['we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] slept ['I', 'I', 'My'] do not know; but ['we', 'our', 'us', 'ou['our sleep', 'it'] must have lasted long, for ['our sleep', 'it'] rested ['we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] completely from ['we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] fatigues. ['I', 'I', 'My'] woke first. ['I', 'I', 'My['My companions', 'their'] had not moved, and were still stretched in ['My companions', 'their'] corner. 
 
Hardly roused from ['my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] somewhat hard couch, ['my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] felt ['my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] brain freed, ['my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] mind clear. ['my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] then began an attentive examination of ['our', 'our', 'w['our cell', 'the cell', 'it']. Nothing was changed inside. The prison was still a prison,—the prisoners, prisoners. However, the steward, during ['our', 'our', 'we'] sleep, had cleared the table. ['my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] breathed with difficulty. The heavy air seemed to oppress ['my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] lungs. Although ['our cell', 'the cell', 'it'] was large, ['our', 'our', 'we'] had evidently consumed a great part of the oxygen that ['our cell', 'the cell', 'it'] contained. Indeed, each man consumes, in one hour, the oxygen contained in ['more than 176 pints of air', 'this air'], and ['more than 176 pints of air', 'this air'], charged (as then) with a nearly equal quantity of carbonic acid, becomes unbreathable. 
 
It became necessary to renew the atmosphere of ['our prison', 'this floating dwelling-place'], and no doubt the whole in the submarine boat. That gave rise to a question in my mind. How would ['the commander of this floating ['our prison', 'this floating dwelling-place'] proceed? Would ['the commander of this floating dwelling-place', 'he', 'he'] obtain air by chemical means, in getting by heat the oxygen contained in chlorate of potash, and in absorbing carbonic acid by caustic potash? Or, a more convenient, economical, and consequently more probable alternative, would ['the commander of this floating dwelling-place', 'he', 'he'] be satisfied to rise and take breath at the surface of the water, like a cetacean, and so renew for twenty-four hours the atmospheric provision? 
 
In fact, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] was already obliged to increase ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] respirations to eke out of ['this cell', 'it'] the little oxygen ['this cell', 'it'] contained, when suddenly ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] was refreshed by ['a current of pure air', 'It'], and perfumed with saline emanations. ['a current of pure air', 'It'] was an invigorating sea breeze, charged with iodine. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] opened ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] mouth wide, and ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my['my lungs', 'themselves'] saturated ['my lungs', 'themselves'] with fresh particles. 
 
At the same time ['I', 'I'] felt ['the boat', 'The iron-plated monster', 'the boat'] rolling. ['the boat', 'The iron-plated monster', 'the boat'] had evidently just risen to the surface of the ocean to breathe, after the fashion of whales. ['I', 'I'] found out from that the mode of ventilating ['the boat', 'The iron-plated monster', 'the boat']. 
 
When ['I', 'I', 'I'] had inhaled this air freely, ['I', 'I', 'I'] sought ['the conduit-pipe, which conveyed to us the beneficial whiff', 'it'], and ['I', 'I', 'I'] was not long in finding ['the conduit-pipe, which conveyed to us the beneficial whiff', 'it']. Above the door was a ventilator, through which volumes of fresh air renewed the impoverished atmosphere of the cell. 
 
['I', 'my'] was making ['I', 'my'] observations, when ['Ned and Conseil', 'They', 'their', 'themselves', 'their'] awoke almost at the same time, under the influence of this reviving air. ['Ned and Conseil', 'They', 'their', 'themselves', 'their'] rubbed ['Ned and Conseil', 'They', 'their', 'themselves', 'their'] eyes, stretched ['Ned and Conseil', 'They', 'their', 'themselves', 'their'], and were on ['Ned and Conseil', 'They', 'their', 'themselves', 'their'] feet in an instant. 
 
“Did master sleep well?” asked ['Conseil', 'his'], with ['Conseil', 'his'] usual politeness. 
 
“Very well, my brave boy. And you, Mr. Land?” 
 
“Soundly, Professor. But ['I', 'I'] don’t know if ['I', 'I'] am right or not; there seems to be a sea breeze!” 
 
A seaman could not be mistaken, and I told ['the Canadian', 'his'] all that had passed during ['the Canadian', 'his'] sleep. 
 
“Good!” said he; “that accounts for those roarings we heard, when the supposed narwhal sighted the _Abraham Lincoln_.” 
 
“Quite so, Master Land; it was taking breath.” 
 
“Only, Mr. Aronnax, I have no idea what o’clock ['it', 'it'] is, unless ['it', 'it'] is dinner-time.” 
 
“Dinner-time! my good fellow? Say rather breakfast-time, for we certainly have begun another day.” 
 
“So,” said Conseil, “we have slept twenty-four hours?” 
 
“That is my opinion.” 
 
“['I', 'Ned Land'] will not contradict you,” replied ['I', 'Ned Land']. “But dinner or breakfast, ['the steward', 'he'] will be welcome, whichever ['the steward', 'he'] brings.” 
 
“Master Land, ['we', 'our'] must conform to the rules on board, and I suppose ['we', 'our'] appetites are in advance of the dinner hour.” 
 
“That is just like ['you', 'friend Conseil', 'You', 'you'], ['you', 'friend Conseil', 'You', 'you'],” said Ned, impatiently. “['you', 'friend Conseil', 'You', 'you'] are never out of temper, always calm; ['you', 'friend Conseil', 'You', 'you'] would return thanks before grace, and die of hunger rather than complain!” 
 
Time was getting on, and ['we', 'us', 'us'] were fearfully hungry; and this time the steward did not appear. It was rather too long to leave ['we', 'us', 'us'], if they really had good intentions towards ['we', 'us', 'us']. ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'himself'], tormented by the cravings of hunger, got still more angry; and, notwithstanding ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'himself'] promise, I dreaded an explosion when ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'himself'] found ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'himself'] with one of the crew. 
 
For two hours more ['Ned Land’s', 'he', 'he'] temper increased; ['Ned Land’s', 'he', 'he'] cried, ['Ned Land’s', 'he', 'he'] shouted, but in vain. The walls were deaf. There was no sound to be heard in ['the boat', 'It', 'it']: all was still as death. ['the boat', 'It', 'it'] did not move, for I should have felt the trembling motion of the hull under the influence of the screw. Plunged in the depths of the waters, ['the boat', 'It', 'it'] belonged no longer to earth:—this silence was dreadful. 
 
I felt terrified, Conseil was calm, Ned Land roared. 
 
Just then a noise was heard outside. Steps sounded on the metal flags. The locks were turned, the door opened, and the steward appeared. 
 
Before I could rush forward to stop ['him', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'him', 'The steward', 'his'], ['him', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'him', 'The steward', 'his'] had thrown ['him', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'him', 'The steward', 'his'] down, and held ['him', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'him', 'The steward', 'his'] by the throat. ['him', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'him', 'The steward', 'his'] was choking under the grip of ['him', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'him', 'The steward', 'his'] powerful hand. 
 
Conseil was already trying to unclasp ['the harpooner’s', 'his'] hand from ['the harpooner’s', 'his'] half-suffocated victim, and ['I', 'I'] was going to fly to the rescue, when suddenly ['I', 'I'] was nailed to the spot by hearing these words in French— 
 
“Be quiet, Master Land; and ['you', 'Professor', 'you'], ['you', 'Professor', 'you'], will ['you', 'Professor', 'you'] be so good as to listen to me?” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER X THE MAN OF THE SEAS 
 
It was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke. 
 
At these words, Ned Land rose suddenly. ['The steward', 'his'], nearly strangled, tottered out on a sign from ['The steward', 'his'] master; but such was the power of ['the commander on board', 'this man'], that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which ['the commander on board', 'this man'] must have felt towards the Canadian. ['Conseil', 'himself'], interested in spite of ['Conseil', 'himself'], I stupefied, awaited in silence the result of this scene. 
 
['The commander', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he'], leaning against the corner of a table with ['The commander', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he'] arms folded, scanned us with profound attention. Did ['The commander', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he'] hesitate to speak? Did ['The commander', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he'] regret the words which ['The commander', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he'] had just spoken in French? One might almost think so. 
 
After some moments of silence, which not one of ['us', 'our'] dreamed of breaking, “['Gentlemen', 'you', 'you', 'your'],” said ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'], in a calm and penetrating voice, “['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] speak French, English, German, and Latin equally well. ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] could, therefore, have answered ['Gentlemen', 'you', 'you', 'your'] at ['us', 'our'] first interview, but ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] wished to know ['Gentlemen', 'you', 'you', 'your'] first, then to reflect. The story told by each one, entirely agreeing in the main points, convinced ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] of ['Gentlemen', 'you', 'you', 'your'] identity. ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] know now that chance has brought before ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] M. Pierre Aronnax, Professor of Natural History at the Museum of Paris, entrusted with a scientific mission abroad, ['Conseil', 'his'], ['Conseil', 'his'] servant, and Ned Land, of Canadian origin, harpooner on board the frigate _Abraham Lincoln_ of the navy of the United States of America.” 
 
['I', 'me', 'I'] bowed assent. It was not a question that the commander put to ['I', 'me', 'I']. Therefore there was no answer to be made. ['This man', 'himself', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'him'] expressed ['This man', 'himself', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'him'] with perfect ease, without any accent. ['This man', 'himself', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'him'] sentences were well turned, ['This man', 'himself', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'him'] words clear, and ['This man', 'himself', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'him'] fluency of speech remarkable. Yet, ['I', 'me', 'I'] did not recognise in ['This man', 'himself', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'him'] a fellow-countryman. 
 
He continued the conversation in these terms: 
 
“['You', 'sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'You'] have doubtless thought, ['You', 'sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'You'], that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] have delayed long in paying ['You', 'sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'You'] this second visit. The reason is that, ['You', 'sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'You'] identity recognised, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards ['You', 'sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'You']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] have hesitated much. Most annoying circumstances have brought ['You', 'sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'You'] into the presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity. ['You', 'sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'You'] have come to trouble ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] existence.” 
 
“Unintentionally!” said I. 
 
“Unintentionally?” replied ['the stranger', 'his', 'me', 'you', 'your', 'my', 'me'], raising ['the stranger', 'his', 'me', 'you', 'your', 'my', 'me'] voice a little; “was it unintentionally that the _Abraham Lincoln_ pursued ['the stranger', 'his', 'me', 'you', 'your', 'my', 'me'] all over the seas? Was it unintentionally that ['the stranger', 'his', 'me', 'you', 'your', 'my', 'me'] took passage in this frigate? Was it unintentionally that ['the stranger', 'his', 'me', 'you', 'your', 'my', 'me'] cannon balls rebounded off the plating of ['the stranger', 'his', 'me', 'you', 'your', 'my', 'me'] vessel? Was it unintentionally that ['Mr. Ned Land', 'his'] struck ['the stranger', 'his', 'me', 'you', 'your', 'my', 'me'] with ['Mr. Ned Land', 'his'] harpoon?” 
 
['I', 'I', 'I'] detected a restrained irritation in these words. But to these recriminations ['I', 'I', 'I'] had ['a very natural answer to make', 'it'] and ['I', 'I', 'I'] made ['a very natural answer to make', 'it']. 
 
“['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you alone', 'you', 'you'],” said ['I', 'I'], “no doubt ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you alone', 'you', 'you'] are ignorant of the discussions which have taken place concerning ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you alone', 'you', 'you'] in ['America and Europe', 'the two continents']. ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you alone', 'you', 'you'] do not know that divers accidents, caused by collisions with ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you alone', 'you', 'you'] submarine machine, have excited public feeling in ['America and Europe', 'the two continents']. ['I', 'I'] omit the hypotheses without number by which it was sought to explain the inexplicable phenomenon of which ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you alone', 'you', 'you'] possess the secret. But ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you alone', 'you', 'you'] must understand that, in pursuing ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you alone', 'you', 'you'] over the high seas of the Pacific, ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'itself'] believed ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'itself'] to be chasing some powerful sea-monster, of which it was necessary to rid the ocean at any price.” 
 
A half-smile curled the lips of the commander: then, in a calmer tone— 
 
“['M. Aronnax', 'he', 'you', 'your'],” ['M. Aronnax', 'he', 'you', 'your'] replied, “dare ['M. Aronnax', 'he', 'you', 'your'] affirm that ['M. Aronnax', 'he', 'you', 'your'] frigate would not as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster?” 
 
This question embarrassed me, for certainly ['Captain Farragut', 'He', 'his', 'he'] might not have hesitated. ['Captain Farragut', 'He', 'his', 'he'] might have thought it ['Captain Farragut', 'He', 'his', 'he'] duty to destroy a contrivance of this kind, as ['Captain Farragut', 'He', 'his', 'he'] would a gigantic narwhal. 
 
“['You', 'sir', 'the stranger', 'I', 'you'] understand then, ['You', 'sir', 'the stranger', 'I', 'you'],” continued ['You', 'sir', 'the stranger', 'I', 'you'], “that ['You', 'sir', 'the stranger', 'I', 'you'] have the right to treat ['You', 'sir', 'the stranger', 'I', 'you'] as enemies?” 
 
I answered nothing, purposely. For what good would it be to discuss such a proposition, when force could destroy the best arguments? 
 
“['I', 'the commander', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] have hesitated some time,” continued ['I', 'the commander', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my']; “nothing obliged ['I', 'the commander', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] to show ['you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] hospitality. If ['I', 'the commander', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] chose to separate ['I', 'the commander', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] from ['you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'], ['I', 'the commander', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] should have no interest in seeing ['you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] again; ['I', 'the commander', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] could place ['you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] upon the deck of this vessel which has served ['you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] as a refuge, ['I', 'the commander', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] could sink beneath the waters, and forget that ['you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] had ever existed. Would not that be ['I', 'the commander', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] right?” 
 
“It might be the right of a savage,” I answered, “but not that of a civilised man.” 
 
“['Professor', 'you', 'you'],” replied ['the commander', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'], quickly, “['the commander', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] am not what ['Professor', 'you', 'you'] call a civilised man! ['the commander', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] have done with ['society', 'its'] entirely, for reasons which I alone have the right of appreciating. ['the commander', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] do not therefore obey ['society', 'it['its laws', 'them'], and ['the commander', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] desire ['Professor', 'you', 'you'] never to allude to ['its laws', 'them'] before ['the commander', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] again!” 
 
This was said plainly. A flash of anger and disdain kindled in the eyes of ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his'], and I had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life of ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his']. Not only had ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his'] put ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his'] beyond the pale of ['human laws', 'them', 'their'], but ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his'] had made ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his'] independent of ['human laws', 'them', 'their'], free in the strictest acceptation of the word, quite beyond ['human laws', 'them', 'their'] reach! Who then would dare to pursue ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his'] at the bottom of ['the sea', 'its'], when, on ['the sea', 'its'] surface, ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his'] defied all attempts made against ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his']? What vessel could resist the shock of ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his'] submarine monitor? What cuirass, however thick, could withstand the blows of ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his'] spur? No man could demand from ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his'] an account of ['the Unknown', 'this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'his'] actions; ['God', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he'], if ['God', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he'] believed in one—['God', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he'] conscience, if ['God', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he'] had one—were the sole judges to whom ['God', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he'] was answerable. 
 
These reflections crossed ['my', 'I'] mind rapidly, whilst ['the stranger personage', 'himself', 'him'] was silent, absorbed, and as if wrapped up in ['the stranger personage', 'himself', 'him']. ['my', 'I'] regarded ['the stranger personage', 'himself', 'him'] with fear mingled with interest, as doubtless, Œdipus regarded the Sphinx. 
 
After rather a long silence, the commander resumed the conversation. 
 
“['I', 'he', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] have hesitated,” said ['I', 'he', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'], “but ['I', 'he', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] have thought that ['I', 'he', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] interest might be reconciled with that pity to which every human being has a right. ['You', 'you', 'You', 'Your'] will remain on board ['I', 'he', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] vessel, since fate has cast ['You', 'you', 'You', 'Your'] there. ['You', 'you', 'You', 'Your'] will be free; and, in exchange for this liberty, ['I', 'he', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] shall only impose ['one single condition', 'it']. ['You', 'you', 'You', 'Your'] word of honour to submit to ['one single condition', 'it'] will suffice.” 
 
“Speak, sir,” ['I', 'I'] answered. “['I', 'I'] suppose this condition is one which a man of honour may accept?” 
 
“Yes, sir; it is this. It is possible that certain events, unforeseen, may oblige ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] to consign ['you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] to ['you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] cabins for some hours or some days, as the case may be. As ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] desire never to use violence, ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] expect from ['you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'], more than all the others, a passive obedience. In thus acting, ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] take all the responsibility: ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] acquit ['you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] entirely, for ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] make it an impossibility for ['you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] to see what ought not to be seen. Do ['you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] accept this condition?” 
 
Then things took place on board which, to say the least, were singular, and which ought not to be seen by people who were not placed beyond the pale of social laws. Amongst the surprises which the future was preparing for me, this might not be the least. 
 
“We accept,” ['I', 'your', 'sir', 'you'] answered; “only I will ask ['I', 'your', 'sir', 'you'] permission, ['I', 'your', 'sir', 'you'], to address one question to ['I', 'your', 'sir', 'you']—one only.” 
 
“Speak, sir.” 
 
“You said that we should be free on board.” 
 
“Entirely.” 
 
“I ask ['you', 'you'], then, what ['you', 'you'] mean by this liberty?” 
 
“Just the liberty to go, to come, to see, to observe even all that passes here,—save under rare circumstances,—the liberty, in short, which ['we', 'ourselves'] enjoy ['we', 'ourselves'], my companions and I.” 
 
It was evident that we did not understand one another. 
 
“Pardon ['me', 'sir', 'I'], ['me', 'sir', 'I'],” ['me', 'sir', 'I'] resumed, “but ['this liberty', 'It'] is only what ['every prisoner', 'his'] has of pacing ['every prisoner', 'his'] prison. ['this liberty', 'It'] cannot suffice us.” 
 
“It must suffice you, however.” 
 
“What! ['we', 'our', 'our', 'our'] must renounce for ever seeing ['we', 'our', 'our', 'our'] country, ['we', 'our', 'our', 'our'] friends, ['we', 'our', 'our', 'our'] relations again?” 
 
“Yes, ['sir', 'you']. But to renounce that unendurable worldly yoke which men believe to be liberty, is not perhaps so painful as ['sir', 'you'] think.” 
 
“Well,” exclaimed ['Ned Land', 'I', 'my'], “never will ['Ned Land', 'I', 'my'] give ['Ned Land', 'I', 'my'] word of honour not to try to escape.” 
 
“['I', 'you', 'your', 'Master Land', 'the commander'] did not ask ['I', 'you', 'your', 'Master Land', 'the commander'] for ['I', 'you', 'your', 'Master Land', 'the commander'] word of honour, ['I', 'you', 'your', 'Master Land', 'the commander'],” answered ['I', 'you', 'your', 'Master Land', 'the commander'], coldly. 
 
“['Sir', 'you', 'your'],” ['I', 'myself'] replied, beginning to get angry in spite of ['I', 'myself'], “['Sir', 'you', 'your'] abuse ['Sir', 'you', 'your'] situation towards us; it is cruelty.” 
 
“No, sir, it is clemency. ['You', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'You', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] are ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself'] prisoners of war. ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself'] keep ['You', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'You', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'], when ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself'] could, by a word, plunge ['You', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'You', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] into the depths of the ocean. ['You', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'You', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] attacked ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself']. ['You', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'You', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] came to surprise a secret which no man in ['the world', 'that world which must know me no more'] must penetrate,—the secret of ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself'] whole existence. And ['You', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'You', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] think that ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself'] am going to send ['You', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'You', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] back to ['the world', 'that world which must know me['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself']o more']? Never! In retaining ['You', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'You', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'], it is not ['You', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'You', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] whom ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself'] guard—it is ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'myself'].” 
 
These words indicated a resolution taken on the part of the commander, against which no arguments would prevail. 
 
“So, ['sir', 'you'],” I rejoined, “['sir', 'you'] give us simply the choice between life and death?” 
 
“Simply.” 
 
“['My', 'I'] friends,” said ['My', 'I'], “to a question thus put, there is nothing to answer. But no word of honour binds us to the master of this vessel.” 
 
“None, sir,” answered the Unknown. 
 
Then, in a gentler tone, he continued— 
 
“Now, permit ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my'] to finish what ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my'] have to say to ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You']. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my'] know ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You'], ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You']. ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'Yo['You and your companions'['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You']ou', 'You'] will not, perhaps, have so much to complain of in the chance which has bound ['You and your companions', 'you', 'You'] to ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my'] fate. ['You and your companions', 'you', 'You'] will find amongst the books which are ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my'] favourite study ['the work which you have['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You']blished on ‘the depths of the sea', 'it'].’ ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my'] have often read ['the work which you have published on ‘the depths of the sea', 'it']. ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You'] have carried out ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You'] work as far as terrestrial science permitted ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You']. But ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You'] do not know all—['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You'] have not seen all. Let ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my'] tell ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You'] then, ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You'], that ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You'] will not regret the time passed on board ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my'] vessel. ['you', 'you', 'M. Aronnax', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'You', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'You'] are going to visit the land of marvels.” 
 
These words of the commander had ['a great effect', 'it'] upon ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself']. ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] cannot deny ['a great effect', 'it']. ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] weak point was touched; and ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] forgot, for a moment, that the contemplation of these sublime subjects was not worth the loss of liberty. Besides, ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] trusted to the future to decide this grave question. So ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] contented ['me', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] with saying— 
 
“By what name ought I to address you?” 
 
“['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'your'],” replied ['the commander', 'I', 'me'], “['the commander', 'I', 'me'] am nothing to ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'your'] but Captain Nemo; and ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'your'] and ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'your'] companions are nothing to ['the commander', 'I', 'me'] but the passengers of the _Nautilus_.” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'The captain', 'his'] called. ['A steward', 'him'] appeared. ['Captain Nemo', 'The captain', 'his'] gave ['A steward', 'him'] ['Captain Nemo', 'The captain', 'his'] orders in that strange language which I did not understand. Then, turning towards the Canadian and Conseil— 
 
“['A repast', 'this man'] awaits ['you', 'your'] in ['you', 'your'] cabin,” said he. “Be so good as to follow ['A repast', 'this man']. 
 
“And now, M. Aronnax, our breakfast is ready. Permit me to lead the way.” 
 
“I am at ['your', 'Captain'] service, ['your', 'Captain'].” 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] followed Captain Nemo; and as soon as ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] had passed through the door, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] found ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] in a kind of passage lighted by electricity, similar to the waist of a ship. After we had proceeded a dozen yards, a second door opened before ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me']. 
 
I then entered ['a dining-room, decorated and furnished in severe taste', 'the room']. ['High oaken sideboards', 'their'], inlaid with ebony, stood at the two extremities of ['a dining-room, decorated and furnished in severe taste', 'the room'], and upon ['High oaken sideboards', 'their'] shelves glittered china, porcelain, and glass of inestimable value. The plate on the table sparkled in the rays which the luminous ceiling shed around, while the light was tempered and softened by exquisite paintings. 
 
In the centre of the room was a table richly laid out. Captain Nemo indicated the place I was to occupy. 
 
The breakfast consisted of ['a certain number of dishes, the contents of which were furnished by the sea alone', 'them', 'they', 'they']; and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] was ignorant of the nature and mode of preparation of some of ['a certain number of dishes, the contents of which were furnished by the sea alone', 'them', 'they', 'they']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] acknowledged that ['a certain number of dishes, the contents of which were furnished by the sea alone', 'them', 'they', 'they'] were good, but ['a certain number of dishes, the contents of which were furnished by the sea alone', 'them', 'they', 'they'] had a peculiar flavour, which ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] easily became accustomed to. ['These different aliments', 'they'] appeared to ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] to be rich in phosphorus, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] thought ['These different aliments', 'they'] must have a marine origin. 
 
Captain Nemo looked at ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I']. ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] asked ['him', 'he', 'his', 'him'] no questions, but ['him', 'he', 'his', 'him'] guessed ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] thoughts, and answered of ['him', 'he', 'his', 'him'] own accord the questions which ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] was burning to address to ['him', 'he', 'his', 'him']. 
 
“The greater part of ['these dishes', 'them', 'They'] are unknown to ['you', 'me', 'you'],” ['he', 'I', 'My'] said to ['you', 'me', 'you']. “However, ['you', 'me', 'you'] may partake of ['these dishes', 'them', 'They'] without fear. ['these dishes', 'them', 'They'] are wholesome and nourishing. For a long time ['he', 'I', 'My'] have renounced ['the food of the earth', 'the same food'], and am never ill now. ['he', 'I', 'My'] crew, who are healthy, are fed on ['the food of the earth', 'the same food'].” 
 
“So,” said I, “all these eatables are the produce of the sea?” 
 
“Yes, Professor, ['the sea', 'this element, which appears to be inaccessible to man'] supplies all ['my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] wants. Sometimes ['my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] cast ['my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself['my nets', 'them'] in tow, and ['my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] draw ['my nets', 'them'] in ready to break. Sometimes ['my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] hunt in the midst of ['the sea', 'this element, which appears to be inaccessible to man'], and quarry the game which dwells in ['my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] submarine forests. ['my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] flocks, like those of Neptune’s old shepherds, graze fearlessly in the immense prairies of the ocean. ['my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] have a vast property there, which ['my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] cultivate ['my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'myself'], and which is always sown by the hand of the Creator of all things.” 
 
“['I', 'I', 'I'] can understand perfectly, ['sir', 'your', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'], that ['sir', 'your', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'] nets furnish excellent fish for ['sir', 'your', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'] table; ['I', 'I', 'I'] can understand also that ['sir', 'your', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'] hunt aquatic game in ['sir', 'your', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'] submarine forests; but ['I', 'I', 'I'] cannot understand at all how a particle of meat, no matter how small, can figure in ['sir', 'your', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'] bill of fare.” 
 
“This, which ['you', 'Professor', 'you', 'you'] believe to be meat, ['you', 'Professor', 'you', 'you'], is nothing else than fillet of turtle. Here are also some dolphins’ livers, which ['you', 'Professor', 'you', 'you'] take to be ragout of pork. ['My', 'me'] cook is a clever fellow, who excels in dressing these various products of the ocean. Taste all these dishes. Here is a preserve of holothuria, which a Malay would declare to be unrivalled in the world; here is a cream, of which the milk has been furnished by the cetacea, and the sugar by the great fucus of the North Sea; and lastly, permit ['My', 'me'] to offer ['you', 'Professor', 'you', 'you'] some preserve of anemones, which is equal to that of the most delicious fruits.” 
 
['I', 'me'] tasted, more from curiosity than as a connoisseur, whilst ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] enchanted ['I', 'me'] with ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] extraordinary stories. 
 
“['You', 'Captain'] like the sea, ['You', 'Captain']?” 
 
“Yes; ['I', 'I', 'I'] love ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its']! ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] is everything. ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] covers seven-tenths of ['the terrestrial globe', 'The globe', 'it', 'it']. ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] breath is pure and healthy. ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] is an immense desert, where ['man', 'he'] is never lonely, for ['man', 'he'] feels life stirring on all sides. ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence. ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] is nothing but love and emotion; ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] is the ‘Living Infinite,’ as one of ['your', 'Professor', 'sir'] poets has said. In fact, ['your', 'Professor', 'sir'], ['Nature', 'herself', 'her', 'Nature'] manifests ['Nature', 'herself', 'her', 'Nature'] in ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] by ['Nature', 'herself', 'her', 'Nature'] three kingdoms, mineral, vegetable, and animal. ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] is the vast reservoir of ['Nature', 'herself', 'her', 'Nature']. ['the terrestrial globe', 'The globe', 'it', 'it'] began with ['sea', 'it'], so to speak; and who knows if ['the terrestrial globe', 'The globe', 'it', 'it'] will not end with ['sea', 'it']? In ['the terrestrial globe', 'The globe', 'it', 'it'] is supreme tranquillity. ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] does not belong to despots. Upon ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] surface ['men', 'their', 'their', 'their'] can still exercise unjust laws, fight, tear one another to pieces, and be carried away with terrestrial horrors. But at thirty feet below ['it', 'The sea', 'It', 'Its', 'It', 'The sea', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'The sea', 'The sea', 'its', 'its'] level, ['men', 'their', 'their', 'their'] reign ceases, ['men', 'their', 'their', 'their'] influence is quenched, and ['men', 'their', 'their', 'their'] power disappears. Ah! ['your', 'Professor', 'sir'], live—live in the bosom of the waters! There only is independence! There ['I', 'I', 'I'] recognise no masters! There ['I', 'I', 'I'] am free!” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his'] suddenly became silent in the midst of this enthusiasm, by which ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his'] was quite carried away. For a few moments ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his'] paced up and down, much agitated. Then ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his'] became more calm, regained ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his'] accustomed coldness of expression, and turning towards me— 
 
“Now, ['Professor', 'you', 'your'],” said ['he', 'I'], “if ['Professor', 'you', 'your'] wish to go over the _Nautilus_, ['he', 'I'] am at ['Professor', 'you', 'your'] service.” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'him'] rose. ['I', 'I', 'I'] followed ['Captain Nemo', 'him']. A double door, contrived at the back of the dining-room, opened, and ['I', 'I', 'I'] entered a room equal in dimensions to that which ['I', 'I', 'I'] had just quitted. 
 
['It', 'the room', 'this room, so ingeniously fitted up'] was a library. ['High pieces of furniture, of black violet ebony inlaid with brass', 'their', 'They'], supported upon ['High pieces of furniture, of black violet ebony inlaid with brass', 'their', 'They'] wide shelves a great number of books uniformly bound. ['High pieces of furniture, of black violet ebony inlaid with brass', 'their', 'They'] followed the shape of ['It', 'the room', 'this room, so ingeniously fitted up'], terminating at the lower part in huge divans, covered with brown leather, which were curved, to afford the greatest comfort. Light movable desks, made to slide in and out at will, allowed one to rest one’s book while reading. In the centre stood an immense table, covered with pamphlets, amongst which were some newspapers, already of old date. The electric light flooded everything; it was shed from four unpolished globes half sunk in the volutes of the ceiling. ['I', 'I', 'my'] looked with real admiration at ['It', 'the room', 'this room, so ingeniously fitted up'], and ['I', 'I', 'my'] could scarcely believe ['I', 'I', 'my'] eyes. 
 
“Captain Nemo,” said ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I['my host, who had just thrown himself on one of th['my host, who had just thrown himself on one of the divans', 'himself', 'you']s', 'himself', 'you'], “['this', 'it'] is a library which would do honour to more than one of the continental palaces, and ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] am absolutely astounded when ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] consider that ['this', 'it'] can follow ['my host, who had just thrown himself on one of the divans', 'himself', 'you'] to the bottom of the seas.” 
 
“Where could one find greater solitude or silence, ['Professor', 'Captain Nemo', 'your', 'you']?” replied ['Professor', 'Captain Nemo', 'your', 'you']. “Did ['Professor', 'Captain Nemo', 'your', 'you'] study in the Museum afford ['Professor', 'Captain Nemo', 'your', 'you'] such perfect quiet?” 
 
“No, ['sir', 'yours', 'You']; and I must confess that it is a very poor one after ['sir', 'yours', 'You']. ['sir', 'yours', 'You'] must have six or seven thousand volumes here.” 
 
“['Twelve thousand', 'These'], M. Aronnax. ['Twelve thousand', 'These'] are the only ties which bind ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I'] to ['the earth', 'the world']. But ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I'] had done with ['the earth', 'the world'] on ['the day when my _Nautilus_ ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I']unged for the first time beneath the waters', 'That day']. ['the day when my _Nautilus_ plunged for the first time beneath the waters', 'That day'] ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I'] bought ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I['my last volumes, my last pamphlets, my las['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I']papers', 'These b['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I']ks', 'them'], and from that time ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I'] wish to think that men no longer think or write. ['my last volumes, my last pamphlets, my last papers', 'These books', 'them'], ['Professor', 'your', 'you'], are at ['Professor', 'your', 'you'] service besides, and ['Professor', 'your', 'you'] can make use of ['my last volumes, my last pamphlets, my last papers', 'These books', 'them'] freely.” 
 
['I', 'I'] thanked ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain of the _Nautilus_', 'he'], and went up to the shelves of the library. Works on science, morals, and literature abounded in every language; but ['I', 'I'] did not see one single work on ['political economy', 'that subject']; ['political economy', 'that subject'] appeared to be strictly proscribed. Strange to say, ['all these books', 'they'] were irregularly arranged, in whatever language ['all these books', 'they'] were written; and this medley proved that ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain of the _Nautilus_', 'he'] must have read indiscriminately the books which ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain of the _Nautilus_', 'he'] took up by chance. 
 
“['Sir', 'you'],” said ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] to the Captain, “['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] thank ['Sir', 'you'] for having placed ['this library', 'It'] at ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] disposal. ['this library', 'It'] contains ['treasures of science', 'them'], and ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] shall profit by ['treasures of science', 'them'].” 
 
“['This room', 'it'] is not only a library,” said Captain Nemo, “['This room', 'it'] is also a smoking-room.” 
 
“A smoking-room!” I cried. “Then one may smoke on board?” 
 
“Certainly.” 
 
“Then, ['sir', 'you'], I am forced to believe that ['sir', 'you'] have kept up a communication with Havannah.” 
 
“Not any,” answered the Captain. “Accept ['this cigar', 'it', 'it'], ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you']; and, though ['this cigar', 'it', 'it'] does not come from Havannah, ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'] will be pleased with ['this cigar', 'it', 'it'], if ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'] are a connoisseur.” 
 
['I', 'me', 'I'] took ['the cigar which was offered me', 'its', 'it', 'it['I', 'me', 'I']; ['the cigar which was offered me', 'its', 'it', 'it'] shape recalled the London ones, but ['the cigar which was offered me', 'its', 'it', 'it'] seemed to be made of leaves of gold. ['I', 'me', 'I'] lighted ['the cigar which was offered me', 'its', 'it', 'it'] at a little brazier, which was supported upon an elegant bronze stem, and drew the first whiffs with the delight of a lover of smoking who has not smoked for two days. 
 
“['It', 'it'] is excellent, but ['It', 'it'] is not tobacco.” 
 
“No!” answered ['the Captain', 'me'], “['this tobacco', 'It'] comes neither from Havannah nor from the East. ['this tobacco', 'It'] is a kind of sea-weed, rich in nicotine, with which the sea provides ['the Captain', 'me'], but somewhat sparingly.” 
 
At that moment Captain Nemo opened a door which stood opposite to that by which ['I', 'I'] had entered the library, and ['I', 'I'] passed into an immense drawing-room splendidly lighted. 
 
['It', 'this museum', 'it'] was a vast four-sided room, thirty feet long, eighteen wide, and fifteen high. A luminous ceiling, decorated with light arabesques, shed a soft clear light over all the marvels accumulated in ['It', 'this museum', 'it']. For ['It', 'this museum', 'it'] was in fact a museum, in which an intelligent and prodigal hand had gathered all the treasures of nature and art, with the artistic confusion which distinguishes a painter’s studio. 
 
Thirty first-rate pictures, uniformly framed, separated by bright drapery, ornamented the walls, which were hung with tapestry of severe design. ['I', 'I', 'me'] saw works of great value, the greater part of which ['I', 'I', 'me'] had admired in the special collections of Europe, and in the exhibitions of paintings. The several schools of the old masters were represented by a Madonna of Raphael, a Virgin of Leonardo da Vinci, a nymph of Corregio, a woman of Titan, an Adoration of Veronese, an Assumption of Murillo, a portrait of Holbein, a monk of Velasquez, a martyr of Ribera, a fair of Rubens, two Flemish landscapes of Teniers, three little “genre” pictures of Gerard Dow, Metsu, and Paul Potter, two specimens of Géricault and Prudhon, and some sea-pieces of Backhuysen and Vernet. Amongst the works of modern painters were pictures with the signatures of Delacroix, Ingres, Decamps, Troyon, Meissonier, Daubigny, etc.; and some admirable statues in marble and bronze, after the finest antique models, stood upon pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum. Amazement, as the Captain of the _Nautilus_ had predicted, had already begun to take possession of ['I', 'I', 'me']. 
 
“['Professor', 'you'],” said ['this strange man', 'I', 'you'], “['Professor', 'you'] must excuse the unceremonious way in which ['this strange man', 'I', 'you'] receive ['this strange man', 'I', 'you'], and the disorder of this room.” 
 
“['Sir', 'you', 'you'],” ['I', 'I'] answered, “without seeking to know who ['Sir', 'you', 'you'] are, ['I', 'I'] recognise in ['Sir', 'you', 'you'] an artist.” 
 
“An amateur, nothing more, ['sir', 'your']. Formerly ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my'] loved to collect ['these beautiful works created by the hand of man', 'them', 'them', 'These']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my'] sought ['these beautiful works created by the hand of man', 'them', 'them', 'These'] greedily, and ferreted ['these beautiful works created by the hand of man', 'them', 'them', 'These'] out indefatigably, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my'] have been able to bring together some objects of great value. ['these beautiful works created by the hand of man', 'them', 'them', 'These'] are ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my'] last souvenirs of that world which is dead to ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my']. In ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my'] eyes, ['sir', 'yo['your modern artists', 'they', 'them'] are already old; ['your modern artists', 'they', 'them'] have two or three thousand years of existence; ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my'] confound ['your modern artists', 'they', 'them'] in ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my'] own mind. Masters have no age.” 
 
“And these musicians?” said I, pointing out some works of Weber, Rossini, Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Meyerbeer, Hérold, Wagner, Auber, Gounod, and a number of others, scattered over a large model piano-organ which occupied one of the panels of the drawing-room. 
 
“These musicians,” replied ['Captain Nemo', 'I'], “are the contemporaries of Orpheus; for in the memory of the dead all chronological differences are effaced; and ['Captain Nemo', 'I'] am dead, ['Professor', 'your']; as much dead as those of ['Professor', 'your'] friends who are sleeping six feet under the earth!” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'he'] was silent, and seemed lost in a profound reverie. ['I', 'my'] contemplated ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'he'] with deep interest, analysing in silence the strange expression of ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'he'] countenance. Leaning on ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'he'] elbow against an angle of a costly mosaic table, ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'he'] no longer saw me,—he had forgotten ['I', 'my'] presence. 
 
['I', 'my'] did not disturb this reverie, and continued ['I', 'my'] observation of the curiosities which enriched this drawing-room. 
 
Under elegant glass cases, fixed by copper rivets, were classed and labelled the most precious productions of the sea which had ever been presented to the eye of a naturalist. My delight as a professor may be conceived. 
 
The division containing the zoophytes presented the most curious specimens of the two groups of polypi and echinodermes. In the first group, the tubipores, were gorgones arranged like a fan, soft sponges of Syria, ises of the Moluccas, pennatules, an admirable virgularia of the Norwegian seas, variegated unbellulairæ, alcyonariæ, a whole series of madrepores, which ['my', 'I'] master Milne Edwards has so cleverly classified, amongst which ['my', 'I'] remarked some wonderful flabellinæ oculinæ of the Island of Bourbon, the “Neptune’s car” of the Antilles, superb varieties of corals—in short, every species of those curious polypi of which entire islands are formed, which will one day become continents. Of the echinodermes, remarkable for ['their', 'this group'] coating of spines, asteri, sea-stars, pantacrinæ, comatules, astérophons, echini, holothuri, etc., represented individually a complete collection of ['their', 'this group']. 
 
A somewhat nervous conchyliologist would certainly have fainted before other more numerous cases, in which were classified ['the specimens of molluscs', 'these specimens']. It was a collection of inestimable value, which time fails ['me', 'I'] to describe minutely. Amongst ['the specimens of molluscs', 'these specimens'] ['me', 'I'] will quote from memory only the elegant royal hammer-fish of the Indian Ocean, whose regular white spots stood out brightly on a red and brown ground, an imperial spondyle, bright-coloured, bristling with spines, a rare specimen in the European museums—(I estimated its value at not less than £1000); a common hammer-fish of the seas of New Holland, which is only procured with difficulty; exotic buccardia of Senegal; fragile white bivalve shells, which a breath might shatter like a soap-bubble; several varieties of the aspirgillum of Java, a kind of calcareous tube, edged with leafy folds, and much debated by amateurs; a whole series of trochi, some a greenish-yellow, found in the American seas, others a reddish-brown, natives of Australian waters; ['others from the Gulf of Mexico, remarkable for their imbri['others from the Gulf of Mexico, remarkable for their imbricated shell', 'their'] shell', 'their']; stellari found in the Southern Seas; and last, the rarest of all, the magnificent spur of New Zealand; and every description of delicate and fragile shells to which science has given appropriate names. 
 
Apart, in separate compartments, were spread out chaplets of ['pearls of the greatest beauty, which reflected the electric light in little sparks of fire', 'these pearls']; pink pearls, torn from the pinna-marina of the Red Sea; green pearls of the haliotyde iris; yellow, blue and black pearls, the curious productions of the divers molluscs of every ocean, and certain mussels of the water-courses of the North; lastly, several specimens of inestimable value which had been gathered from the rarest pintadines. Some of ['pearls of the greatest beauty, which reflected the electric light in little sparks of fire', 'these pearls'] were larger than a pigeon’s egg, and were worth as much, and more than that which the traveller Tavernier sold to the Shah of Persia for three millions, and surpassed the one in the possession of the Imaum of Muscat, which I had believed to be unrivalled in the world. 
 
Therefore, to estimate the value of this collection was simply impossible. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his'] must have expended millions in the acquirement of these various specimens, and ['I', 'I'] was thinking what source ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his'] could have drawn from, to have been able thus to gratify ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his'] fancy for collecting, when ['I', 'I'] was interrupted by these words— 
 
“['You', 'Professor'] are examining ['my shells', 'they', 'they', 'them all['my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my'] 'all'], ['You', 'Professor']? Unquestionably ['my shells', 'they', 'they', 'them all', 'all'] must be interesting to a naturalist; but for ['my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my'] ['my shells', 'they', 'they', 'them all', 'all'] have a far greater charm, for ['my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my'] have collected ['my shells', 'they', 'they', 'them all', 'al['my shells', 'they', 'they', 'them all', 'all'] with ['my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my'] own hand, and there is not a sea on the face of the globe which has escaped ['my', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'my'] researches.” 
 
“['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] can understand, ['Captain', 'You', 'your'], the delight of wandering about in the midst of such riches. ['Captain', 'You', 'your'] are one of ['those who have collected their treasures themselve['those who have collected their treasures themselves', 'their', 'themselves']their', 'th['those who have collected their treasures themselves', 'their', 'themselves']. No museum in Europe possesses ['such a collection of the produce of the ocean', 'it', 'it']. But if ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] exhaust all ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] admiration upon ['such a collection of the produce of the ocean', 'it', 'it'], ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] shall have none left for ['the vessel which carries it', 'this _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it['such a collection of the produce of the ocean', 'it', 'it']. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] do not wish to pry into ['Captain', 'You', 'your'] secrets; but ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] must confess that ['the vessel which carries it', 'this _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it'], with the motive power which is confined in ['the vessel which carries it', 'this _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it'], the contrivances which enable ['the vessel which carries it', 'this _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it'] to be worked, the powerful agent which propels ['the vessel which carries it', 'this _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it'], all excite ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] curiosity to the highest pitch. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] see suspended on the walls of this room instruments of whose use ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] am ignorant.” 
 
“['You', 'Professor', 'you', 'your', 'You', 'you'] will find ['these same instruments', 'their'] in ['my', 'I'] own room, ['You', 'Professor', 'you', 'your', 'You', 'you'], where ['my', 'I'] shall have much pleasure in explaining ['these same instruments', 'their'] use to ['You', 'Professor', 'you', 'your', 'You', 'you']. But first come and inspect the cabin which is set apart for ['You', 'Professor', 'you', 'your', 'You', 'you'] own use. ['You', 'Professor', 'you', 'your', 'You', 'you'] must see how ['You', 'Professor', 'you', 'your', 'You', 'you'] will be accommodated on board the _Nautilus_.” 
 
['I', 'me', 'I'] followed ['Captain Nemo, who, by one of the doors opening from each panel of the drawing-room, regained the waist', 'He']. ['Captain Nemo, who, by one of the doors opening from each panel of the drawing-room, regained the waist', 'He'] conducted ['I', 'me', 'I'] towards the bow, and there ['I', 'me', 'I'] found, not a cabin, but an elegant room, with a bed, dressing-table, and several other pieces of furniture. 
 
['I', 'my'] could only thank ['I', 'my'] host. 
 
“Your room adjoins ['mine', 'he', 'mine'],” said ['mine', 'he', 'mine'], opening a door, “and ['mine', 'he', 'mine'] opens into the drawing-room that we have just quitted.” 
 
I entered ['the Captain’s room', 'it', 'the whole']: ['the Captain’s room', 'it', 'the whole'] had a severe, almost a monkish, aspect. A small iron bedstead, a table, some articles for the toilet; ['the Captain’s room', 'it', 'the whole'] lighted by a skylight. No comforts, the strictest necessaries only. 
 
Captain Nemo pointed to a seat. 
 
“Be so good as to sit down,” ['he', 'he'] said. ['I', 'myself'] seated ['I', 'myself'], and ['he', 'he'] began thus:

CHAPTER XI ALL BY ELECTRICITY 
 
“['Sir', 'me', 'you'],” said ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I'], showing ['Sir', 'me', 'you'] ['the instruments hanging on the walls of his room', 'them',['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I']hey'], “here are the contrivances required for the navigation of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_']. Here, as in the drawing-room, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I'] have ['the instruments hanging on the walls of his room', 'them', 'they'] always under ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I'] eyes, and ['the instruments hanging on the walls of his room', 'them', 'they'] indicate ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I'] position and exact direction in the middle of the ocean. Some are known to ['Sir', 'me', 'you'], such as the thermometer, which gives the internal temperature of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_'];_ the barometer, which indicates the weight of the air and foretells the changes of the weather; the hygrometer, which marks the dryness of the atmosphere; the storm-glass, the contents of which, by decomposing, announce the approach of tempests; the compass, which guides ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I'] course; the sextant, which shows the latitude by the altitude of the sun; chronometers, by which ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I'] calculate the longitude; and glasses for day and night, which ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I'] use to examine the points of the horizon, when ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_'] rises to the surface of the waves.” 
 
“['These', 'them'] are the usual nautical instruments,” ['I', 'I'] replied, “and ['I', 'I'] know the use of ['These', 'them']. But these others, no doubt, answer to the particular requirements of the _Nautilus_. ['This dial with the movable needle', 'it'] is a manometer, is ['This dial with the movable needle', 'it'] not?” 
 
“['It', 'it', 'it'] is actually a manometer. But by communication with the water, whose external pressure ['It', 'it', 'it'] indicates, ['It', 'it', 'it'] gives our depth at the same time.” 
 
“And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot guess?” 
 
“Here, ['Professor', 'you', 'you'], ['I', 'me'] ought to give ['Professor', 'you', 'you'] some explanations. Will ['Professor', 'you', 'you'] be kind enough to listen to ['I', 'me']?” 
 
['He', 'he'] was silent for a few moments, then ['He', 'he'] said— 
 
“There is ['a powerful agent, obedient, rapid, easy, which conforms to every use, and reigns supreme on board my vessel', 'it', 'It', 'Thi['my vessel', 'i['my', 'my'], 'it']. Everything is done by means of ['a powerful agent, obedient, rapid, easy, which conforms to every use, and reigns supreme on board my vessel', 'it', 'It', 'This agent']. ['a powerful agent, obedient, rapid, easy, which conforms to every use, and reigns supreme on board my vessel', 'it', 'It', 'This agent'] lights ['my vessel', 'it', 'it'], warms ['my vessel', 'it', 'it'], and is the soul of ['my', 'my'] mechanical apparatus. ['a powerful agent, obedient, rapid, easy, which conforms to every use, and reigns supreme on board my vessel', 'it', 'It', 'This agent'] is electricity.” 
 
“Electricity?” I cried in surprise. 
 
“Yes, sir.” 
 
“Nevertheless, ['Captain', 'you', 'its'], ['Captain', 'you', 'its'] possess an extreme rapidity of movement, which does not agree with the power of electricity. Until now, ['Captain', 'you', 'its'] dynamic force has remained under restraint, and has only been able to produce a small amount of power.” 
 
“Professor,” said ['Captain Nemo', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'], “['Captain Nemo', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] electricity is not everybody’s. You know what sea-water is composed of. In a thousand grammes are found 96½ per cent. of water, and about 2-2/3 per cent. of chloride of sodium; then, in a smaller quantity, chlorides of magnesium and of potassium, bromide of magnesium, sulphate of magnesia, sulphate and carbonate of lime. You see, then, that chloride of sodium forms a large part of it. So it is this sodium that ['Captain Nemo', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] extract from sea-water, and of which ['Captain Nemo', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] compose ['Captain Nemo', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] ingredients. ['Captain Nemo', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] owe all to ['the ocean', 'it']; ['the ocean', 'it'] produces electricity, and electricity gives heat, light, motion, and, in a word, life to the _Nautilus_.” 
 
“But not the air you breathe?” 
 
“Oh! ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] could manufacture ['the air necessary for my consu['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me']tion', 'it'], but ['the air necessary for my consumption', 'it'] is useless, because ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] go up to the surface of the water when ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] please. However, if ['electricity', 'it', 'It'] does not furnish ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] with air to breathe, ['electricity', 'it', 'It'] works at least the powerful pumps that are stored in spacious reservoirs, and which enable ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] to prolong at need, and as long as ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] will, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] stay in the depths of ['the sea', 'the sea']. ['electricity', 'it', 'It'] gives a uniform and unintermittent light, which ['the sun', 'sun'] does not. Now look at ['this clock', 'it', 'it']; ['this clock', 'it', 'it'] is electrical, and goes with a regularity that defies the best chronometers. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] have divided ['this clock', 'it', 'it'] into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, because for ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] there is neither night nor day, ['the sun', 'sun'] nor moon, but only that factitious light that ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] take with ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] to the bottom of ['the sea', 'the sea']. Look! just now, it is ten o’clock in the morning.” 
 
“Exactly.” 
 
“Another application of electricity. ['This dial hanging in front of us', 'it['us', 'we'] indicates the speed of the _Nautilus_. An electric thread puts ['This dial hanging in front of us', 'it'] in communication with the screw, and the needle indicates the real speed. Look! now ['us', 'we'] are spinning along with a uniform speed of fifteen miles an hour.” 
 
“It is marvelous! And I see, ['Captain', 'you'], ['Captain', 'you'] were right to make use of this agent that takes the place of wind, water, and steam.” 
 
“['We', 'we'] have not finished, ['M. Aronnax', 'you'],” said ['Captain Nemo', 'me'], rising. “If ['M. Aronnax', 'you'] will follow ['Captain Nemo', 'me'], ['We', 'we'] will examine the stern of the _Nautilus_.” 
 
Really, ['I', 'mine'] knew already the anterior part of ['this submarine boat', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_'], of which this is the exact division, starting from ['this submarine boat', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_'] head:—the dining-room, five yards long, separated from the library by a water-tight partition; the library, five yards long; the large drawing-room, ten yards long, separated from the Captain’s room by a second water-tight partition; the said room, five yards in length; ['I', 'mine'], two and a half yards; and, lastly a reservoir of air, seven and a half yards, that extended to the bows. Total length thirty five yards, or one hundred and five feet. The partitions had ['doors that were shut hermetically by means of india-rubber instruments', 'they'], and ['doors that were shut hermetically by means of india-rubber instruments', 'they'] ensured the safety of ['this submarine boat', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus', 'the['this submarine boat', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_'] in case of a leak. 
 
['I', 'I'] followed ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain'] through the waist, and arrived at the centre of the boat. There was a sort of well that opened between two partitions. ['An iron ladder, fastened with an iron hook to the partition', 'the ladder'], led to the upper end. ['I', 'I'] asked ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain'] what ['An iron ladder, fastened with an iron hook to the partition', 'the ladder'] was used for. 
 
“It leads to the small boat,” he said. 
 
“What! have you a boat?” I exclaimed, in surprise. 
 
“Of course; an excellent vessel, light and insubmersible, that serves either as a fishing or as a pleasure boat.” 
 
“But then, when you wish to embark, you are obliged to come to the surface of the water?” 
 
“Not at all. ['This boat', 'it', 'It', 'the boat', 'the small vessel', 'the little boat', 'it'] is attached to the upper part of ['the hull of the _Nautilus_', 'the hull of th['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus'], and occupies a cavity made for ['This boat', 'it', 'It', 'the boat', 'the small vessel', 'the little boat', 'it']. ['This boat', 'it', 'It', 'the boat', 'the small vessel', 'the little boat', 'it'] is decked, quite water-tight, and held together by ['solid bolts', 'the bolts']. This ladder leads to a man-hole made in ['the hull of the _Nautilus_', 'the hull of th['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus'], that corresponds with a similar hole made in the side of ['This boat', 'it', 'It', 'the boat', 'the small vessel', 'the little boat', 'it']. By this double opening ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] get into ['This boat', 'it', 'It', 'the boat', 'the small vessel', 'the little boat', 'it']. They shut the one belonging to ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus'];_ ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] shut the other by means of screw pressure. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] undo ['solid bolts', 'the bolts'], and ['This boat', 'it', 'It', 'the boat', 'the small vessel', 'the little boat', 'it'] goes up to the surface of the sea with prodigious rapidity. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] then open the panel of the bridge, carefully shut till then; ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] mast ['This boat', 'it', 'It', 'the boat', 'the small vessel', 'the little boat', 'it'], hoist ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] sail, take ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I'] oars, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I']’m off.” 
 
“But how do you get back on board?” 
 
“['I', 'me'] do not come back, M. Aronnax; the _Nautilus_ comes to ['I', 'me'].” 
 
“By your orders?” 
 
“By ['my', 'I'] orders. An electric thread connects us. ['my', 'I'] telegraph to it, and that is enough.” 
 
“Really,” I said, astonished at these marvels, “nothing can be more simple.” 
 
After having passed by the cage of the staircase that led to the platform, I saw ['a cabin six feet long, in which Conseil ['Conseil and Ned Land', 'their', 'They']ted with their re['Conseil and Ned Land', 'their', 'They'] were devouring it with ['a cabin six feet long, in which Conseil and Ned Land, enchanted with their repast, were devouring it with avidity', 'it']idity', 'it']. Then a door opened into ['a kitchen nine feet long, situated between the large storerooms', 'this kitchen']. There electricity, better than ['gas itself', 'it['gas itself', 'itself'], did all the cooking. The streams under the furnaces gave out to the sponges of platina a heat which was regularly kept up and distributed. ['Conseil and Ned Land', 'their', 'They'] also heated a distilling apparatus, which, by evaporation, furnished excellent drinkable water. Near ['a kitchen nine feet long, situated between the large storerooms', 'this kitchen'] was a bathroom comfortably furnished, with hot and cold water taps. 
 
Next to the kitchen was the berthroom of ['the vessel, sixteen feet long', 'the _Nautilus_']. But ['the door', 'it'] was shut, and ['I', 'me'] could not see the management of ['the door', 'it'], which might have given ['I', 'me'] an idea of the number of men employed on board ['the vessel, sixteen feet long', 'the _Nautilus_']. 
 
At the bottom was a fourth partition that separated this office from ['the engine-room', 'This engine-room']. A door opened, and ['I', 'myself', 'I'] found ['I', 'myself', 'I'] in ['the compartment where Captain Nemo—c['Captain Nemo—certainly an engineer of a very high order—', 'his']is locomotive['Captain Nemo—certainly an engineer of a very high order—', 'his']chinery', 'It', 'it']. ['the engine-room', 'This engine-room'], clearly lighted, did not measure less than sixty-five feet in length. ['the compartment where Captain Nemo—certainly an engineer of a very high order—had arranged his locomotive machinery', 'It', 'it'] was divided into two parts; ['the first', 'it'] contained the materials for producing electricity, and the second the machinery that connected ['the first', 'it'] with the screw. ['I', 'myself', 'I'] examined ['the compartment where Captain Nemo—certainly an engineer of a very high order—had arranged his locomotive machinery', 'It', 'it'] with great interest, in order to understand the machinery of the _Nautilus_. 
 
“You see,” said ['the Captain', 'I'], “['the Captain', 'I'] use ['Bunsen’s co['Bunsen’s', 'Bunsen’s']es', 'Those'], not Ruhmkorff’s. ['Bunsen’s contrivances', 'Those'] would not have been powerful enough. ['Bunsen’s', 'Bunsen’s'] are fewer in number, but strong and large, which experience proves to be the best. ['The electricity produced', 'it'] passes forward, where ['The electricity produced', 'it'] works, by electro-magnets of great size, on a system of levers and cog-wheels that transmit the movement to the axle of the screw. This one, the diameter of which is nineteen feet, and the thread twenty-three feet, performs about a hundred and twenty revolutions in a second.” 
 
“And you get then?” 
 
“A speed of fifty miles an hour.” 
 
“['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] have seen ['the _Nautilus_ manœuvre', 'its', 'it'] before the _Abraham Lincoln_, and ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] have ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I['my own ideas as to its speed'['the _Nautilus_ manœuvre', 'its', 'it']this']. But ['my own ideas as to its speed', 'this'] is not enough. ['We', 'we', 'We'] must see where ['We', 'we', 'We'] go. ['We', 'we', 'We'] must be able to direct ['the _Nautilus_ manœuvre', 'its', 'it'] to the right, to the left, above, below. How do you get to the great depths, where you find an increasing resistance, which is rated by hundreds of atmospheres? How do you return to the surface of the ocean? And how do you maintain yourselves in the requisite medium? Am ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] asking too much?” 
 
“Not at all, ['Professor', 'you', 'you', 'you'],” replied the Captain, with some hesitation; “since ['Professor', 'you', 'you', 'you'] may never leave this submarine boat. Come into the saloon, it is our usual study, and there ['Professor', 'you', 'you', 'you'] will learn all ['Professor', 'you', 'you', 'you'] want to know about the _Nautilus_.” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XII SOME FIGURES 
 
A moment after we were seated on a divan in the saloon smoking. ['The Captain', 'he', 'his'] showed me a sketch that gave the plan, section, and elevation of the _Nautilus_. Then ['The Captain', 'he', 'his'] began ['The Captain', 'he', 'his'] description in these words:— 
 
“Here, M. Aronnax, are the several dimensions of ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it']. ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it'] is an elongated cylinder with conical ends. ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it'] is very like a cigar in shape, a shape already adopted in London in several constructions of the same sort. The length of ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it'], from stem to stern, is exactly 232 feet, and ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it'] maximum breadth is twenty-six feet. ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it'] is not built quite like your long-voyage steamers, but ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it'] lines are sufficiently long, and ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it'] curves prolonged enough, to allow ['the water', 'its'] to slide off easily, and oppose no obstacle to ['the water', 'its'] passage. These two dimensions enable you to obtain by a simple calculation the surface and cubic contents of ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it']. ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it'] area measures 6032 feet; and ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it'] contents about 1500 cubic yards—that is to say, when completely immersed ['the boat you are in', 'It', 'It', 'this cylinder', 'its', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'its', 'it'] displaces 50,000 feet of water, or weighs 1500 tons. 
 
“When ['I', 'I', 'I'] made the plans for ['this submarine vessel', 'it', 'its', 'it'], ['I', 'I', 'I'] meant that nine-tenths should be submerged: consequently, ['this submarine vessel', 'it', 'its', 'it'] ought only to displace nine-tenths of ['this submarine vessel', 'it', 'its', 'it'] bulk—that is to say, only to weigh ['that number of tons', 'that weight']. ['I', 'I', 'I'] ought not, therefore, to have exceeded ['that number of tons', 'that weight'], constructing ['this submarine vessel', 'it', 'its', 'it'] on the aforesaid dimensions. 
 
“['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'Its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] is composed of two hulls, one inside, the other outside, joined by T-shaped irons, which render ['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'Its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] very strong. Indeed, owing to this cellular arrangement ['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'Its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] resists like a block, as if ['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'Its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] were solid. ['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'Its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] sides cannot yield; ['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'Its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] coheres spontaneously, and not by the closeness of ['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'Its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] rivets; and the homogenity of ['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'Its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] construction, due to the perfect union of the materials, enables ['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'Its', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] to defy the roughest seas. 
 
“These two hulls are composed of steel plates, whose density is from .7 to .8 that of water. The first is not less than two inches and a half thick and weighs 394 tons. The second envelope, the keel, twenty inches high and ten thick, weighs alone sixty-two tons. The engine, the ballast, the several accessories and apparatus appendages, the partitions and bulkheads, weigh 961.62 tons. Do you follow all this?” 
 
“I do.” 
 
“Then, when ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat, weighing then 1507 tons', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel'] is afloat under these circumstances, ['one-tenth', 'this tenth'] is out of the water. Now, if ['I', 'I', 'I'] have made ['reservoirs of a size equal to this tenth, or capable of hold['one-tenth', 'this tenth']ns', 'them', 'These reservoirs'], and if ['I', 'I', 'I'] fill ['reservoirs of a size equal to this tenth, or capable of holding 150 tons', 'them', 'These reservoirs'] with water, ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat, weighing then 1507 tons', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel'], will be completely immersed. That would happen, Professor. ['reservoirs of a size equal to this tenth, or capable of holding 150 tons', 'them', 'These reservoirs'] are in the lower parts of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat, weighing then 1507 tons', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel']. ['I', 'I', 'I'] turn on ['taps', 'they'] and ['taps', 'they'] fill, and ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat, weighing then 1507 tons', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel'] sinks that had just been level with the surface.” 
 
“Well, ['Captain', 'your', 'your'], but now we come to the real difficulty. I can understand ['Captain', 'your', 'your'] rising to ['the surface', 'the surface']; but diving below ['the surface', 'the surface'], does not ['Captain', 'your', 'your'] submarine contrivance encounter a pressure, and consequently undergo an upward thrust of one atmosphere for every thirty feet of water, just about fifteen pounds per square inch?” 
 
“Just so, sir.” 
 
“Then, unless ['you', 'you'] quite fill ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'], I do not see how ['you', 'you'] can draw ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] down to those depths.” 
 
“['Professor', 'you', 'you'], ['Professor', 'you', 'you'] must not confound statics with dynamics or ['Professor', 'you', 'you'] will be exposed to grave errors. There is very little labour spent in attaining the lower regions of the ocean, for all bodies have a tendency to sink. When ['I', 'I'] wanted to find out the necessary increase of weight required to sink the _Nautilus_, ['I', 'I'] had only to calculate the reduction of volume that sea-water acquires according to the depth.” 
 
“That is evident.” 
 
“Now, if ['water', 'it'] is not absolutely incompressible, ['water', 'it'] is at least capable of ['very slight compression', 'this reduction']. Indeed, after the most recent calculations ['very slight compression', 'this reduction'] is only .000436 of an atmosphere for each thirty feet of depth. If we want to sink 3000 feet, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] should keep account of the reduction of bulk under a pressure equal to that of a column of water of a thousand feet. The calculation is easily verified. Now, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] have ['supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons', 'all the reservoirs']. Therefore ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] can sink to a considerable depth. When ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] wish to rise to the level of the sea, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] only let off the water, and empty ['supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons', 'all the reservoirs'] if ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] want ['the _Nautilus_', 'her'] to emerge from the tenth part of ['the _Nautilus_', 'her'] total capacity.” 
 
I had nothing to object to these reasonings. 
 
“['I', 'your', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', 'I'] admit ['I', 'your', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', ['your calculations', 'them', 'them'], ['I', 'your', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', 'I'],” ['I', 'your', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', 'I'] replied; “['I', 'your', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', 'I'] should be wrong to dispute ['your calculations', 'them', 'them'] since daily experience confirms ['your calculations', 'them', 'them']; but ['I', 'your', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', 'I'] foresee a real difficulty in the way.” 
 
“What, sir?” 
 
“When you are about 1000 feet deep, the walls of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel'] bear ['a pressure of 100 atmospheres', 'the pressure of 100 atmospheres, which is 1500 pounds per square inch']. If, then, just now you were to empty the supplementary reservoirs, to lighten ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel'], and to go up to the surface, the pumps must ['overcome', 'that'] ['a pressure of 100 atmospheres', 'the pressure of 100 atmospheres, which is 1500 pounds per square inch']. From ['overcome', 'that'] a power——” 
 
“That electricity alone can give,” said ['the Captain', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'], hastily. “['the Captain', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] repeat, ['sir', 'you'], that the dynamic power of ['the Captain', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] engines is almost infinite. ['The pumps of the _Nautilus_', 'their'] have an enormous power, as ['sir', 'you'] must have observed when ['The pumps of the _Nautilus_', 'their'] jets of water burst like a torrent upon the _Abraham Lincoln_. Besides ['the Captain', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] ['use', 'that'] subsidiary reservoirs only to attain a mean depth of 750 to 1000 fathoms, and ['use', 'that'] with a view of managing ['the Captain', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] machines. Also, when ['the Captain', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] have a mind to visit the depths of the ocean five or six miles below the surface, ['the Captain', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] make use of slower but not less infallible means.” 
 
“What are they, Captain?” 
 
“That involves my telling you how the _Nautilus_ is worked.” 
 
“I am impatient to learn.” 
 
“To steer ['this boat', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the boat', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] to starboard or port, to turn—in a word, following a horizontal plan, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] use an ordinary rudder fixed on the back of the stern-post, and with one wheel and some tackle to steer by. But ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] can also make ['this boat', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the boat', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] rise and sink, and sink and rise, by a vertical movement by means of two inclined planes fastened to ['this boat', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the boat', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] sides, opposite the centre of flotation, planes that move in every direction, and that are worked by powerful levers from the interior. If the planes are kept parallel with ['this boat', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the boat', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'], ['this boat', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the boat', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] ['moves', 'this inclination'] horizontally. If slanted, ['this boat', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the boat', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'], according to ['moves', 'this inclination'], and under the influence of ['the screw', 'the screw'], either sinks diagonally or rises diagonally as it suits ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I']. And even if ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] wish to rise more quickly to the surface, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] ship ['the screw', 'the screw'], and the pressure of the water causes ['this boat', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the boat', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] to rise vertically like a balloon filled with hydrogen.” 
 
“Bravo, Captain! But how can the steersman follow the route in the middle of the waters?” 
 
“The steersman is placed in a glazed box, that is raised about the hull of the _Nautilus_, and furnished with lenses.” 
 
“Are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure?” 
 
“Perfectly. Glass, which breaks at a blow, is, nevertheless, capable of offering considerable resistance. During some experiments of fishing by electric light in 1864 in the Northern Seas, we saw plates less than a third of an inch thick resist a pressure of sixteen atmospheres. Now, the glass that I use is not less than thirty times thicker.” 
 
“Granted. But, after all, in order to see, the light must exceed the darkness, and in the midst of the darkness in the water, how can you see?” 
 
“Behind the steersman’s cage is placed a powerful electric reflector, the rays from which light up the sea for half a mile in front.” 
 
“Ah! bravo, bravo, ['Captain', 'you']! Now ['I', 'I'] can account for this phosphorescence in the supposed narwhal that puzzled us so. ['I', 'I'] now ask ['Captain', 'you'] if the boarding of the _Nautilus_ and of the _Scotia_, that has made such a noise, has been the result of a chance rencontre?” 
 
“Quite accidental, sir. I was sailing only one fathom below the surface of the water, when ['the shock', 'It'] came. ['the shock', 'It'] had no bad result.” 
 
“None, ['sir', 'your']. But now, about ['sir', 'your'] rencontre with the _Abraham Lincoln?_” 
 
“Professor, ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'myself'] am sorry for ['one of the best vessels in the American navy', 'they', 'the frigate', 'she']; but ['one of the best vessels in the American navy', 'they', 'the frigate', 'she'] attacked ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'myself'], and ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'myself'] was bound to defend ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'myself']. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'myself'] contented ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'myself'], however, with putting ['one of the best vessels in the American navy', 'they', 'the frigate', 'she'] _hors de combat;_ ['one of the best vessels in the American navy', 'they', 'the frigate', 'she'] will not have any difficulty in getting repaired at the next port.” 
 
“Ah, ['Commander', 'your']! ['Commander', 'your'] _Nautilus_ is certainly a marvellous boat.” 
 
“Yes, ['Professor', 'your', 'sir', 'you']; and ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I'] love ['it', 'it'] as if ['it', 'it'] were part of ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I']. If danger threatens one of ['Professor', 'your', 'sir', 'you'] vessels on the ocean, the first impression is the feeling of an abyss above and below. On ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'it alone', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel', 'my _Nautilus'] ['men’s', 'them'] hearts never fail ['men’s', 'them']. No defects to be afraid of, for the double shell is as firm as iron; no rigging to attend to; no sails for the wind to carry away; no boilers to burst; no fire to fear, for ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'it alone', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel', 'my _Nautilus'] is made of iron, not of wood; no coal to run short, for electricity is the only mechanical agent; no collision to fear, for ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'it alone', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel', 'my _Nautilus'] swims in deep water; no tempest to brave, for when ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'it alone', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel', 'my _Nautilus'] dives below the water, ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'it alone', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel', 'my _Nautilus'] reaches absolute tranquillity. There, ['Professor', 'your', 'sir', 'you']! that is the perfection of vessels! And if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'it alone', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel', 'my _Nautilus'] than ['the builder', 'the builder'], and ['the builder', 'the builder'] than ['the captain himself', 'hi['the captain himself', 'himself'], ['Professor', 'your', 'sir', 'you'] understand the trust ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I'] repose in ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'it alone', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel', 'my _Nautilus'];_ for ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I'] am at once captain, builder, and engineer.” 
 
“But how could you construct this wonderful _Nautilus_ in secret?” 
 
“Each separate portion, M. Aronnax, was brought from different parts of the globe. The keel was forged at Creusot, the shaft of the screw at Penn & Co.’s, London, the iron plates of the hull at Laird’s of Liverpool, the screw itself at Scott’s at Glasgow. The reservoirs were made by Cail & Co. at Paris, the engine by Krupp in Prussia, ['its', 'its'] beak in Motala’s workshop in Sweden, ['its', 'its'] mathematical instruments by Hart Brothers, of New York, etc.; and each of these people had my orders under different names.” 
 
“But these parts had to be put together and arranged?” 
 
“Professor, ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] had set up ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] workshops upon ['a desert island in the ocean', 'this island']. There ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] workmen, that is to say, the brave men that ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] instructed and educated, and ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] have put together ['our', 'our'] _Nautilus_. Then when the work was finished, fire destroyed all trace of ['our', 'our'] proceedings on ['a desert island in the ocean', 'this island'], that ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] could have jumped over if ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] had liked.” 
 
“Then the cost of this vessel is great?” 
 
“M. Aronnax, an iron vessel costs £145 per ton. Now ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] weighed 1500. It came therefore to £67,500, and £80,000 more for fitting ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] up, and about £200,000 with the works of art and the collections ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] contains.” 
 
“One last question, Captain Nemo.” 
 
“Ask it, Professor.” 
 
“You are rich?” 
 
“Immensely rich, sir; and I could, without missing it, pay the national debt of France.” 
 
['I', 'my'] stared at ['the singular person who spoke thus', 'he']. Was ['the singular person who spoke thus', 'he'] playing upon ['I', 'my'] credulity? The future would decide that. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XIII THE BLACK RIVER 
 
['The portion of the terrestrial globe which is covered by w['the terrestrial globe', 'the earth']ss', 'This mass of fluid'] is estimated at upwards of eighty millions of acres. ['The portion of the terrestrial globe which is covered by water', 'This fluid mass', 'This mass of fluid'] comprises two billions two hundred and fifty millions of cubic miles, forming a spherical body of a diameter of sixty leagues, the weight of which would be three quintillions of tons. To comprehend the meaning of these figures, it is necessary to observe that a quintillion is to a billion as a billion is to unity; in other words, there are as many billions in a quintillion as there are units in a billion. ['The portion of the terrestrial globe which is covered by water', 'This fluid mass', 'This mass of fluid'] is equal to about the quantity of water which would be discharged by all the rivers of ['the terrestrial globe', 'the earth'] in forty thousand years. 
 
During the geological epochs, the igneous period succeeded to the aqeous. The ocean originally prevailed everywhere. Then by degrees, in the silurian period, the tops of the mountains began to appear, the islands emerged, then disappeared in partial deluges, reappeared, became settled, formed continents, till at length the earth became geographically arranged, as we see in the present day. The solid had wrested from the liquid thirty-seven million six hundred and fifty-seven square miles, equal to twelve billion nine hundred and sixty millions of acres. 
 
The shape of continents allows us to divide the waters into five great portions: the Arctic or Frozen Ocean, the Antarctic or Frozen Ocean, the Indian, the Atlantic, and the Pacific Oceans. 
 
['The Pacific Ocean', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'the ocean'] extends from north to south between the two polar circles, and from east to west between Asia and America, over an extent of 145 degrees of longitude. ['The Pacific Ocean', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'the ocean'] is the quietest of seas; ['The Pacific Ocean', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'the ocean'] currents are broad and slow, ['The Pacific Ocean', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'the ocean'] has medium tides, and abundant rain. Such was ['The Pacific Ocean', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'the ocean'] that ['my', 'me'] fate destined ['my', 'me'] first to travel over under these strange conditions. 
 
“['Sir', 'you'],” said ['Captain Nemo', 'I'], “['we', 'our'] will, if ['Sir', 'you'] please, take ['we', 'our'] bearings and fix ['the starting-point of this voyage', 'It']. ['the starting-point of this voyage', 'It'] is a quarter to twelve; ['Captain Nemo', 'I'] will go up again to the surface.” 
 
The Captain pressed an electric clock three times. The pumps began to drive the water from the tanks; the needle of the manometer marked by a different pressure the ascent of the _Nautilus_, then it stopped. 
 
“We have arrived,” said the Captain. 
 
['I', 'myself'] went to the central staircase which opened on to the platform, clambered up the iron steps, and found ['I', 'myself'] on the upper part of the _Nautilus_. 
 
The platform was only three feet out of water. The front and back of ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'this boat'] was of that spindle-shape which caused ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'this boat'] justly to be compared to a cigar. ['I', 'me'] noticed that ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'this boat'] iron plates, slightly overlaying each other, resembled the shell which clothes the bodies of our large terrestrial reptiles. It explained to ['I', 'me'] how natural it was, in spite of all glasses, that ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'this boat'] should have been taken for a marine animal. 
 
Toward the middle of the platform the long-boat, half buried in the hull of the vessel, formed a slight excrescence. Fore and aft rose two cages of medium height with inclined sides, and partly closed by thick lenticular glasses; one destined for the steersman who directed the _Nautilus_, the other containing a brilliant lantern to give light on the road. 
 
The sea was beautiful, the sky pure. Scarcely could the long vehicle feel the broad undulations of the ocean. A light breeze from the east rippled the surface of the waters. The horizon, free from fog, made observation easy. Nothing was in sight. Not a quicksand, not an island. A vast desert. 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He'], by the help of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He'] sextant, took the altitude of ['the sun', 'its', 'the instrument'], which ought also to give the latitude. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He'] waited for some moments till ['the sun', 'its', 'the instrument'] disc touched the horizon. Whilst taking observations not a muscle moved, ['the sun', 'its', 'the instrument'] could not have been more motionless in a hand of marble. 
 
[Illustration] Captain Nemo took the Sun’s altitude 
 
“Twelve o’clock, ['sir', 'you'],” said he. “When ['sir', 'you'] like——” 
 
I cast a last look upon the sea, slightly yellowed by the Japanese coast, and descended to the saloon. 
 
“And now, ['sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'], ['I', 'the Captain', 'I', 'Captain Nemo', 'the commander of the _Nautilus_'] leave ['sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'] to ['sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'] studies,” added ['I', 'the Captain', 'I', 'Captain Nemo', 'the commander of the _Nautilus_']; “['our', 'ou['our course', 'it'] is E.N.E., ['our', 'our'] depth is twenty-six fathoms. Here are maps on a large scale by which ['sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'] may follow ['our course', 'it']. The saloon is at ['sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'] disposal, and with ['sir', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your'] permission, ['I', 'the Captain', 'I', 'Captain Nemo', 'the commander of the _Nautilus_'] will retire.” ['I', 'the Captain', 'I', 'Captain Nemo', 'the commander of the _Nautilus_'] bowed, and I remained alone, lost in thoughts all bearing on ['I', 'the Captain', 'I', 'Captain Nemo', 'the commander of the _Nautilus_']. 
 
For a whole hour was ['I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my'] deep in these reflections, seeking to pierce this mystery so interesting to ['I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my']. Then ['I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my'] eyes fell upon the vast planisphere spread upon the table, and ['I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my'] placed ['I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'my'] finger on the very spot where the given latitude and longitude crossed. 
 
['The sea', 'its'] has ['The sea', 'its'] large rivers like the continents. ['They', 'their', 'their', 'these'] are special currents known by ['They', 'their', 'their', 'these'] temperature and ['They', 'their', 'their', 'these'] colour. The most remarkable of ['They', 'their', 'their', 'these'] is known by the name of the Gulf Stream. Science has decided on the globe the direction of five principal currents: one in the North Atlantic, a second in ['the South', 'the South'], a third in the North Pacific, a fourth in ['the South', 'the South'], and a fifth in the Southern Indian Ocean. It is even probable that a sixth current existed at one time or another in the Northern Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral Seas formed but one vast sheet of water. 
 
At this point indicated on the planisphere one of these currents was rolling, the Kuro-Scivo of the Japanese, the Black River, which, leaving the Gulf of Bengal, where ['it', 'it'] is warmed by the perpendicular rays of a tropical sun, crosses the Straits of Malacca along the coast of Asia, turns into the North Pacific to the Aleutian Islands, carrying with ['it', 'it'] trunks of camphor-trees and other indigenous productions, and edging the waves of ['the ocean', 'its'] with the pure indigo of ['the ocean', 'its'] warm water. It was ['this current', 'it', 'it', 'itself', 'it'] that the _Nautilus_ was to follow. ['I', 'my', 'myself'] followed ['this current', 'it', 'it', 'itself', 'it'] with ['I', 'my', 'myself'] eye; saw ['this current', 'it', 'it', 'itself', 'it'] lose ['this current', 'it', 'it', 'itself', 'it'] in the vastness of the Pacific, and felt ['I', 'my', 'myself'] drawn with ['this current', 'it', 'it', 'itself', 'it'], when Ned Land and Conseil appeared at the door of the saloon. 
 
['My two brave companions', 'them'] remained petrified at the sight of the wonders spread before ['My two brave companions', 'them']. 
 
“Where are ['we', 'we'], where are ['we', 'we']?” exclaimed the Canadian. “In the museum at Quebec?” 
 
“['My', 'I['My friends', 'them', 'you'],” ['My', 'I'] answered, making a sign for ['My friends', 'them', 'you'] to enter, “['My friends', 'them', 'you'] are not in Canada, but on board the _Nautilus_, fifty yards below the level of the sea.” 
 
“But, ['M. Aronnax', 'you'],” said ['Ned Land', 'me'], “can ['M. Aronnax', 'you'] tell ['Ned Land', 'me'] how many men there are on board? Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred?” 
 
“['I', 'I'] cannot answer ['you', 'Mr. Land'], ['you', 'Mr. Land']; it is better to abandon for a time all idea of seizing ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'This ship', 'it'] or escaping from ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'This ship', 'it']. ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'This ship', 'it'] is a masterpiece of modern industry, and ['I', 'I'] should be sorry not to have seen ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'This ship', 'it']. Many people would accept the situation forced upon ['us', 'us', 'us'], if only to move amongst such wonders. So be quiet and let ['us', 'us', 'us'] try and see what passes around ['us', 'us', 'us'].” 
 
“See!” exclaimed the harpooner, “but ['we', 'We', 'we'] can see nothing in this iron prison! ['we', 'We', 'we'] are walking—['we', 'We', 'we'] are sailing—blindly.” 
 
Ned Land had scarcely pronounced these words when all was suddenly darkness. The luminous ceiling was gone, and so rapidly that my eyes received a painful impression. 
 
['We', 'us'] remained mute, not stirring, and not knowing what surprise awaited ['We', 'us'], whether agreeable or disagreeable. A sliding noise was heard: one would have said that panels were working at the sides of the _Nautilus_. 
 
“It is the end of the end!” said Ned Land. 
 
Suddenly light broke at each side of the saloon, through two oblong openings. The liquid mass appeared vividly lit up by the electric gleam. ['Two crystal plates', 'them'] separated us from the sea. At first I trembled at the thought that this frail partition might break, but strong bands of copper bound ['Two crystal plates', 'them'], giving an almost infinite power of resistance. 
 
['The sea', 'it', 'the ocean'] was distinctly visible for a mile all round the _Nautilus_. What a spectacle! What pen can describe ['The sea', 'it', 'the ocean']? Who could paint the effects of the light through those transparent sheets of water, and the softness of the successive gradations from the lower to the superior strata of ['The sea', 'it', 'the ocean']? 
 
We know ['the transparency of the sea', 'its transpa['the sea', 'its', 'it', 'its'] and that ['the sea', 'its', 'it', 'its'] clearness is far beyond that of rock-water. The mineral and organic substances which ['the sea', 'its', 'it', 'its'] holds in suspension heightens ['the sea', 'its', 'it', 'it['the transparency of the sea', 'its transparency']. In certain parts of the ocean at the Antilles, under seventy-five fathoms of water, can be seen with surprising clearness a bed of sand. The penetrating power of the solar rays does not seem to cease for a depth of one hundred and fifty fathoms. But in this middle fluid travelled over by the _Nautilus_, ['the electric brightness', 'It'] was produced even in the bosom of the waves. ['the electric brightness', 'It'] was no longer luminous water, but liquid light. 
 
On each side a window opened into this unexplored abyss. The obscurity of the saloon showed to advantage the brightness outside, and we looked out as if this pure crystal had been the glass of an immense aquarium. 
 
“['You', 'friend Ned', 'you'] wished to see, ['You', 'friend Ned', 'you']; well, ['You', 'friend Ned', 'you'] see now.” 
 
“Curious! curious!” muttered ['the Canadian, who, forgetting his ill-t['the Canadian, who, forgetting his ill-temper, seemed to submit to some irresistible attraction', 'his']er, seemed to submit to some irresistible attraction', 'his']; “and one would come further than this to admire such a sight!” 
 
“Ah!” thought ['I', 'myself', 'I'] to ['I', 'myself', 'I'], “['I', 'myself', 'I'] understand the life of ['this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'his']; ['this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'his'] has made a world apart for ['this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'his'], in which ['this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'his'] treasures all ['this man', 'he', 'himself', 'he', 'his'] greatest wonders.” 
 
For two whole hours an aquatic army escorted the _Nautilus_. During ['their', 'their'] games, ['their', 'their'] bounds, while rivalling each other in beauty, brightness, and velocity, I distinguished the green labre; the banded mullet, marked by a double line of black; the round-tailed goby, of a white colour, with violet spots on the back; the Japanese scombrus, a beautiful mackerel of ['those seas', 'the seas'], with a blue body and silvery head; the brilliant azurors, whose name alone defies description; some banded spares, with variegated fins of blue and yellow; the woodcocks of ['those seas', 'the seas'], some specimens of which attain a yard in length; Japanese salamanders, spider lampreys, serpents six feet long, with eyes small and lively, and a huge mouth bristling with teeth; with many other species. 
 
['Our imagination', 'its'] was kept at ['Our imagination', 'its'] height, interjections followed quickly on each other. Ned named ['the fish', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'these animals, alive and at liberty, in their natural element', 'their'], and Conseil classed ['the fish', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'these animals, alive and at liberty, in their natural element', 'their']. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] was in ecstasies with the vivacity of ['the fish', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'these animals, alive and at liberty, in their natural element', 'their'] movements and the beauty of ['the fish', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'these animals, alive and at liberty, in their natural element', 'their'] forms. Never had it been given to ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] to surprise ['the fish', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'these animals, alive and at liberty, in their natur['the fish', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'these animals, alive and at liberty, in their natural element', 'their']ement', 'their']. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] will not mention all the varieties which passed before ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] dazzled eyes, all the collection of the seas of China and Japan. These fish, more numerous than the birds of the air, came, attracted, no doubt, by the brilliant focus of the electric light. 
 
Suddenly there was daylight in the saloon, the iron panels closed again, and the enchanting vision disappeared. But for a long time ['I', 'my', 'I'] dreamt on till ['I', 'my', 'I'] eyes fell on the instruments hanging on the partition. The compass still showed the course to be E.N.E., the manometer indicated a pressure of five atmospheres, equivalent to a depth of twenty-five fathoms, and the electric log gave a speed of fifteen miles an hour. ['I', 'my', 'I'] expected ['Captain Nemo', 'he'], but ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] did not appear. The clock marked the hour of five. 
 
['Ned Land and Conseil', 'their'] returned to ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'their'] cabin, and ['I', 'my', 'My', 'me'] retired to ['I', 'my', 'My', 'me'] chamber. ['I', 'my', 'My', 'me['My dinner', 'It'] was ready. ['My dinner', 'It'] was composed of turtle soup made of the most delicate hawksbills, of a surmullet served with puff paste (['the liver of which, prepared by itself, was ['the liver of which, prepared by itself, was most delicious)', 'itself']elicious)', 'itself'], and fillets of the emperor-holocanthus, the savour of which seemed to ['I', 'my', 'My', 'me'] superior even to salmon. 
 
['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] passed the evening reading, writing, and thinking. Then sleep overpowered ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'my'], and ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] stretched ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] on ['I', 'me', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] couch of zostera, and slept profoundly, whilst the _Nautilus_ was gliding rapidly through the current of the Black River. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XIV A NOTE OF INVITATION 
 
The next day was the 9th of November. ['I', 'I', 'I'] awoke after a long sleep of twelve hours. ['Conseil', 'I', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'the worthy fellow', 'he', 'him'] came, according to custom, to know “how ['Conseil', 'I', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'the worthy fellow', 'he', 'him'] had passed the night,” and to offer ['Conseil', 'I', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'the worthy fellow', 'he', 'him'] services. ['Conseil', 'I', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'the worthy fellow', 'he', 'him'] had left ['Conseil', 'I', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'the worthy fellow', 'he', 'him'] friend the Canadian sleeping like ['a man who had never done anything else all his life'['a man who had never done anything else all his life', 'his']his']. ['I', 'I', 'I'] let ['Conseil', 'I', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'the worthy fellow', 'he', 'him'] chatter as ['Conseil', 'I', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'the worthy fellow', 'he', 'him'] pleased, without caring to answer ['Conseil', 'I', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'the worthy fellow', 'he', 'him']. ['I', 'I', 'I'] was pre-occupied by the absence of ['the Captain', 'him'] during our sitting of the day before, and hoping to see ['the Captain', 'him'] to-day. 
 
As soon as ['I', 'I'] was dressed ['I', 'I'] went into ['the saloon', 'It']. ['the saloon', 'It'] was deserted. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I'] plunged into the study of the shell treasures hidden behind the glasses. ['I', 'I', 'I'] revelled also in great herbals filled with ['the rarest marine plants, which, although dried up, retained their lovely colours', 'their', 'these pr['the rarest marine plants, which, although dried up, retained their lovely colours', 'their', 'these precious hydrophytes']s hydrophytes']. Amongst ['the rarest marine plants, which, although dried up, retained their lovely colours', 'their', 'these precious hydrophytes'] ['I', 'I', 'I'] remarked some vorticellæ, pavonariæ, delicate ceramies with scarlet tints, some fan-shaped agari, and some natabuli like flat mushrooms, which at one time used to be classed as zoophytes; in short, a perfect series of algæ. 
 
The whole day passed without my being honoured by a visit from Captain Nemo. The panels of the saloon did not open. Perhaps they did not wish us to tire of these beautiful things. 
 
The course of ['the _Nautilus_', 'her'] was E.N.E., ['the _Nautilus_', 'her'] speed twelve knots, the depth below the surface between twenty-five and thirty fathoms. 
 
The next day, 10th of November, the same desertion, the same solitude. ['I', 'me'] did not see one of the ship’s crew: ['Ned and Conseil', 'They'] spent the greater part of the day with ['I', 'me']. ['Ned and Conseil', 'They'] were astonished at the inexplicable absence of ['the Captain', 'this singular man', 'he', 'his']. Was ['the Captain', 'this singular man', 'he', 'his'] ill?—had ['the Captain', 'this singular man', 'he', 'his'] altered ['the Captain', 'this singular man', 'he', 'his'] intentions with regard to us? 
 
After all, as Conseil said, ['we', 'we', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us', 'we'] enjoyed perfect liberty, ['we', 'we', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us', 'we'] were delicately and abundantly fed. ['we', 'we', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us', 'w['Our host', 'his'] kept to ['Our host', 'his'] terms of the treaty. ['we', 'we', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us', 'we'] could not complain, and, indeed, ['the singularity of our fate['we', 'we', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us', 'we']'it'] reserved such wonderful compensation for ['we', 'we', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us', 'we'], that ['we', 'we', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us', 'we'] had no right to accuse ['the singularity of our fate', 'it'] as yet. 
 
That day ['I', 'me', 'I'] commenced ['the journal of these ad['these adventures', 'them']as enabled me to re['I', 'me', 'I']te them wit['these adventures', 'them']re scrupulous exactitude and minute detail', 'it']. ['I', 'me', 'I'] wrote ['the journal of these adventures which has enabled me to relate them with more scrupulous exactitude and minute detail', 'it'] on paper made from the zostera marina. 
 
11th November, early in the morning. The fresh air spreading over the interior of the _Nautilus_ told ['me', 'I', 'my'] that ['we', 'our'] had come to the surface of the ocean to renew ['we', 'our'] supply of oxygen. ['me', 'I', 'my'] directed ['me', 'I', 'my'] steps to the central staircase, and mounted the platform. 
 
It was six o’clock, the weather was cloudy, the sea grey but calm. Scarcely a billow. ['Captain Nemo, whom I hoped to meet', 'he', 'the steersman imprisoned in his glas['I', 'I', 'I'] cage', 'his'], would ['Captain Nemo, whom I hoped to meet', 'he', 'the steersman imprisoned in his glass cage', 'his'] be there? ['I', 'I', 'I'] saw no one but ['Captain Nemo, whom I hoped to meet', 'he', 'the steersman imprisoned in his glass['Captain Nemo, whom I hoped to meet', 'he', 'the steersman imprisoned in his glass cage', 'his']ge', 'his']. Seated upon the projection formed by the hull of the pinnace, ['I', 'I', 'I'] inhaled the salt breeze with delight. 
 
By degrees the fog disappeared under the action of the sun’s rays, the radiant orb rose from behind the eastern horizon. ['The sea', 'its'] flamed under ['The sea', 'its'] glance like a train of gunpowder. The clouds scattered in the heights were coloured with lively tints of beautiful shades, and numerous “mare’s tails,” which betokened wind for that day. But what was wind to this _Nautilus_ which tempests could not frighten! 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] was admiring this joyous rising of the sun, so gay, and so lifegiving, when ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] heard steps approaching ['the platform', 'the platform']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] was prepared to salute ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain’s'], but it was ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain’['his second (whom I had already seen on the Captain’['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] first visit)', 'He',['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain’s'], 'he', 'he'] who appeared. ['his second (whom I had already seen on the Captain’s first visit)', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he'] advanced on ['the platform', 'the platform'], not seeming to see ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I']. With ['his second (whom I had already seen on the Captain’s first visit)', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he'] powerful glass to ['his second (whom I had already seen on the Captain’s first visit)', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he'] eye ['his second (whom I had already seen on the Captain’s first visit)', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he'] ['scanned', 'This examination'] every point of the horizon with great attention. ['scanned', 'This examination'] over, ['his second (whom I had already seen on the Captain’s first visit)', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'he'] approached the panel and pronounced ['a sentence', 'it', 'it', 'It'] in exactly these terms. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] have remembered ['a sentence', 'it', 'it', 'It'], for every morning ['a sentence', 'it', 'it', 'It'] was repeated under exactly the same conditions. ['a sentence', 'it', 'it', 'It'] was thus worded— 
 
“Nautron respoc lorni virch.” 
 
What it meant I could not say. 
 
These words pronounced, the second descended. ['I', 'I', 'my'] thought that ['the _Nautilus_', 'its'] was about to return to ['the _Nautilus_', 'its'] submarine navigation. ['I', 'I', 'my'] regained the panel and returned to ['I', 'I', 'my'] chamber. 
 
Five days sped thus, without any change in our situation. Every morning I mounted the platform. The same phrase was pronounced by the same individual. But Captain Nemo did not appear. 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] had made up ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] mind that ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] should never see him again, when, on the 16th November, on returning to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] room with Ned and Conseil, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] found upon ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] table ['a note addressed to me', 'it', 'It', 'The note['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I']. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] opened ['a note addressed to me', 'it', 'It', 'The note'] impatiently. ['a note addressed to me', 'it', 'It', 'The note'] was written in a bold, clear hand, the characters rather pointed, recalling the German type. ['a note addressed to me', 'it', 'It', 'The note'] was worded as follows— 
 
16th of _November_, 1867. 
 
TO PROFESSOR ARONNAX, On board the _Nautilus_. 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he'] invites ['Professor Aronnax', 'the Professor', 'him', 'his'] to a hunting-party, which will take place to-morrow morning in the forests of the island of Crespo. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he'] hopes that nothing will prevent ['Professor Aronnax', 'the Professor', 'him', 'his'] from being present, and ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he'] will with pleasure see ['Professor Aronnax', 'the Professor', 'him', 'his'] joined by ['Professor Aronnax', 'the Professor', 'him', 'his'] companions. 
 
CAPTAIN NEMO, Commander of the _Nautilus_. 
 
“A hunt!” exclaimed Ned. 
 
“And in the forests of the island of Crespo!” added Conseil. 
 
“Oh! then the gentleman is going on _terra firma?_” replied Ned Land. 
 
“That seems to ['me', 'I'] to be clearly indicated,” said ['me', 'I'], reading the letter once more. 
 
“Well, ['we', 'we'] must accept,” said ['the Canadian', 'I']. “But once more on dry ground, ['we', 'we'] shall know what to do. Indeed, ['the Canadian', 'I'] shall not be sorry to eat a piece of fresh venison.” 
 
Without seeking to reconcile what was contradictory between ['Captain Nemo’s', 'his'] manifest aversion to islands and continents, and ['Captain Nemo’s', 'his'] invitation to hunt in a forest, ['I', 'myself'] contented ['I', 'myself'] with replying— 
 
“Let us first see where the island of Crespo is.” 
 
['I', 'I'] consulted the planisphere, and in 32° 40′ north lat. and 157° 50′ west long., ['I', 'I'] found a small island, recognised in 1801 by Captain Crespo, and marked in the ancient Spanish maps as Rocca de la Plata, the meaning of which is “The Silver Rock.” ['We', 'our'] were then about eighteen hundred miles from ['We', 'our'] starting-point, and the course of ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'], a little changed, was bringing ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] back towards the south-east. 
 
['I', 'my'] showed this little rock lost in the midst of the North Pacific to ['I', 'my'] companions. 
 
“If ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] does sometimes go on dry ground,” said I, “['Captain Nemo', 'he'] at least chooses desert islands.” 
 
Ned Land shrugged his shoulders without speaking, and Conseil and he left me. 
 
After supper, which was served by the steward mute and impassive, I went to bed, not without some anxiety. 
 
The next morning, the 17th of November, on awakening, ['I', 'I'] felt that the _Nautilus_ was perfectly still. ['I', 'I'] dressed quickly and entered the saloon. 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'him'] was there, waiting for ['me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'myself']. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'him'] rose, bowed, and asked ['me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'myself'] if it was convenient for ['me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'myself'] to accompany ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'him']. As ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'him'] made no allusion to ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'hi['his absence during the last eight days', 'it'], ['me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'myself'] did not mention ['his absence during the last eight days', 'it'], and simply answered that ['me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'myself'] companions and ['me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'myself'] were ready to follow ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'him']. 
 
We entered the dining-room, where breakfast was served. 
 
“['M. Aronnax', 'you'],” said ['the Captain', 'my', 'I', 'I'], “pray, share ['the Captain', 'my', 'I', 'I'] breakfast without ceremony; ['we', 'we'] will chat as ['we', 'we'] eat. For though ['the Captain', 'my', 'I', 'I'] promised ['M. Aronnax', 'you'] a walk in the forest, ['the Captain', 'my', 'I', 'I'] did not undertake to find hotels there. So breakfast as ['a man who will most likely not have his dinne['a man who will most likely not have his dinner till very late', 'his']ill very late', 'his'].” 
 
I did honour to the repast. It was composed of several kinds of fish, and slices of holothuridæ (excellent zoophytes), and different sorts of sea-weed. Our drink consisted of pure water, to which ['the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he'] added some drops of a fermented liquor, extracted by the Kamschatcha method from a sea-weed known under the name of _Rhodomenia palmata_. ['the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he'] ate at first without saying a word. Then ['the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he'] began— 
 
“['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'Sir', 'you'], when ['I', 'my', 'me'] proposed to ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'Sir', 'you'] to hunt in ['I', 'my', 'me'] submarine forest of Crespo, ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'Sir', 'you'] evidently thought ['I', 'my', 'me'] mad. ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'Sir', 'you'], ['Sir', 'you', 'you', 'Sir', 'you'] should never judge lightly of any man.” 
 
“But Captain, believe me——” 
 
“Be kind enough to listen, and ['you', 'you'] will then see whether ['you', 'you'] have any cause to accuse me of folly and contradiction.” 
 
“I listen.” 
 
“['You', 'Professor'] know as well as I do, ['You', 'Professor'], ['that man', 'he', 'him'] can live under water, providing ['that man', 'he', 'him'] carries with ['that man', 'he', 'him'] a sufficient supply of breathable air. In submarine works, ['the workman, clad in an impervious dress, with his head ['the workman, clad in an impervious dress, with his head in a metal helmet', 'his']a metal helmet', 'his'], receives air from above by means of forcing pumps and regulators.” 
 
“That is a diving apparatus,” said I. 
 
“Just so, but under these conditions ['the man', 'he', 'him'] is not at liberty; ['the man', 'he', 'him'] is attached to the pump which sends ['the man', 'he', 'him'] air through an india-rubber tube, and if ['we', 'we'] were obliged to be thus held to the _Nautilus_, ['we', 'we'] could not go far.” 
 
“And the means of getting free?” I asked. 
 
“It is to use ['the Rouquayrol apparatus, invented by two of your own['your', 'you']ntrymen, which I have b['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my']ought to perfection for my own u['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my']', 'It'], and which will allow ['your', 'you'] to risk yourself under these new physiological conditions without any organ whatever suffering. ['the Rouquayrol apparatus, invented by two of your own countrymen, which I have brought to perfection for my own use', 'It'] consists of ['a reservoir of thick iron plates, in which I store the air under a pre['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my']sure of fifty atmospheres', 'This reservoir', 'Its']. ['a reservoir of thick iron plates, in which I store the air under a pressure of fifty atmospheres', 'This reservoir', 'Its'] is fixed on the back by means of braces, like a soldier’s knapsack. ['a reservoir of thick iron plates, in which I store the air under a pressure of fifty atmospheres', 'This reservoir', 'Its'] upper part forms ['a box in which the air is kep['the air', 'its']ans of a bellows, and therefore cannot escape unless at its normal ten['the air', 'its']n', 'this box']. In the Rouquayrol apparatus such as we use, ['two india-rubber pipes', 'the two pipes, the inspirator and the expirator'] leave ['a box in which the air is kept by means of a bellows, and therefore cannot escape unless at its normal tension', 'this box'] and join a sort of tent which holds the nose and mouth; one is to introduce fresh air, the other to let out the foul, and the tongue closes one or the other according to the wants of the respirator. But ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'], in encountering great pressures at the bottom of the sea, was obliged to shut ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] head, like that of a diver in ['a ball of copper', 'this ball of copper']; and it is to ['a ball of copper', 'this ball of copper'] that ['two india-rubber pipes', 'the two pipes, the inspirator and the expirator'], open.” 
 
“Perfectly, ['Captain Nemo', 'you', 'you']; but ['the air that you carry with['Captain Nemo', 'you', 'you']u', 'it', 'i['Captain Nemo', 'you', 'you'] must soon be used; when ['the air that you carry with you', 'it', 'it'] only contains fifteen per cent. of oxygen ['the air that you carry with you', 'it', 'it'] is no longer fit to breathe.” 
 
“Right! But ['I', 'me'] told ['you', 'M. Aronnax'], ['you', 'M. Aronnax'], that the pumps of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the apparatus'] allow ['I', 'me'] to store the air under ['considerable pressure', 'those conditions'], and on ['considerable pressure', 'those conditions'] the reservoir of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the apparatus'] can furnish breathable air for nine or ten hours.” 
 
“['I', 'I', 'I', 'you', 'Captain', 'you', 'your'] have no further objections to make,” ['I', 'I', 'I', 'you', 'Captain', 'you', 'your'] answered; “['I', 'I', 'I', 'you', 'Captain', 'you', 'your'] will only ask ['I', 'I', 'I', 'you', 'Captain', 'you', 'your'] one thing, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'you', 'Captain', 'you', 'your']—how can ['I', 'I', 'I', 'you', 'Captain', 'you', 'your'] light ['I', 'I', 'I', 'you', 'Captain', 'you', 'your'] road at the bottom of the sea?” 
 
“With ['the Ruhmkorff apparatus', 'the apparatus'], M. Aronnax; ['one', 'It'] is carried on the back, the other is fastened to the waist. ['one', 'It'] is composed of a Bunsen pile, which ['I', 'I', 'I'] do not work with bichromate of potash, but with sodium. A wire is introduced which collects ['the electricity produced', 'it'], and directs ['the electricity produced', 'it'] towards ['a particularly made lantern', 'this lantern']. In ['a particularly made lantern', 'this lantern'] is a spiral glass which contains ['a small quantity of carbonic gas', 'this gas']. When ['the Ruhmkorff apparatus', 'the apparatus'] is at work ['a small quantity of carbonic gas', 'this gas'] becomes luminous, giving out a white and continuous light. Thus provided, ['I', 'I', 'I'] can breathe and ['I', 'I', 'I'] can see.” 
 
“['Captain Nemo', 'you'], to all ['my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] objections ['Captain Nemo', 'you'] make such crushing answers, that ['my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] dare no longer doubt. But if ['my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am forced to admit the Rouquayrol and Ruhmkorff apparatus, ['my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] must be allowed some reservations with regard to the gun ['my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am to carry.” 
 
“But it is not a gun for powder,” answered the Captain. 
 
“Then it is an air-gun.” 
 
“Doubtless! How would you have me manufacture gunpowder on board, without either saltpetre, sulphur, or charcoal?” 
 
“Besides,” I added, “to fire under water in a medium eight hundred and fifty-five times denser than the air, we must conquer very considerable resistance.” 
 
“That would be no difficulty. There exist guns, according to ['Fulton', 'I', 'I'], perfected in England by Philip Coles and Burley, in France by Furcy, and in Italy by Landi, which are furnished with a peculiar system of closing, which can fire under these conditions. But ['Fulton', 'I', 'I'] repeat, having no powder, ['Fulton', 'I', 'I'] use air under great pressure, which the pumps of the _Nautilus_ furnish abundantly.” 
 
“But this air must be rapidly used?” 
 
“Well, have ['I', 'my', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'yourself'] not ['I', 'my', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'yourself['my Rouquayrol reservoir, which can furnish it at ne['my Rouquayrol reservoir, which can furnish it at need', 'it']', 'it']? A tap is all that is required. Besides, ['I', 'my', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'yourself'], ['I', 'my', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'yourself'] must see ['I', 'my', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'yourself'] that, during ['our', 'we'] submarine hunt, ['our', 'we'] can spend but little air and but few balls.” 
 
“But it seems to me that in this twilight, and in the midst of this fluid, which is very dense compared with the atmosphere, shots could not go far, nor easily prove mortal.” 
 
“Sir, on the contrary, with this gun every blow is mortal; and however lightly ['the animal', 'it'] is touched, ['the animal', 'it'] falls as if struck by a thunderbolt.” 
 
“Why?” 
 
“Because the balls sent by this gun are not ordinary balls, but ['little cases of glass (invented by Leniebroek, an Austrian chemist), of which I have a large supply', 'These glass cases', 'they', '['I', 'I']hey', 'these cases']. ['little cases of glass (invented by Leniebroek, an Austrian chemist), of which I have a large supply', 'These glass cases', 'they', 'they', 'these cases'] are covered with a case of steel, and weighted with a pellet of lead; ['little cases of glass (invented by Leniebroek, an Austrian chemist), of which I have a large supply', 'These glass cases', 'they', 'they', 'these cases'] are real Leyden bottles, into which the electricity is forced to a very high tension. With the slightest shock ['little cases of glass (invented by Leniebroek, an Austrian chemist), of which I have a large supply', 'These glass cases', 'they', 'they', 'these cases'] are discharged, and ['the animal', 'it'], however strong ['the animal', 'it'] may be, falls dead. ['I', 'I'] must tell you that ['little cases of glass (invented by Leniebroek, an Austrian chemist), of which I have a large supply', 'These glass cases', 'they', 'they', 'these cases'] are size number four, and that the charge for an ordinary gun would be ten.” 
 
“['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'you'] will argue no longer,” ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'you'] replied, rising from the table; “['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'you'] have nothing left ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'you'] but to take ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'you'] gun. At all events, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'you'] will go where ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'you'] go.” 
 
Captain Nemo then led ['me', 'I', 'my'] aft; and in passing before Ned’s and Conseil’s cabin, ['me', 'I', 'my'] called ['me', 'I', 'my'] two companions, who followed immediately. ['We', 'we', 'our'] then came to a kind of cell near the machinery-room, in which ['We', 'we', 'our'] were to put on ['We', 'we', 'our'] walking-dress. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XV A WALK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA 
 
This cell was, to speak correctly, the arsenal and wardrobe of the _Nautilus_. A dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition, waiting our use. 
 
['Ned Land', 'himself'], on seeing them, showed evident repugnance to dress ['Ned Land', 'himself'] in one. 
 
“But, my worthy Ned, the forests of the Island of Crespo are nothing but submarine forests.” 
 
“Good!” said ['the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh meat fade away'['the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh meat fade away', 'his', 'you', 'you', 'yourself']his', 'you', 'you', 'yourself']. “And ['the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh meat fade away', 'his', 'you', 'you', 'yourself'], M. Aronnax, are ['the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh meat fade away', 'his', 'you', 'you', 'yourself'] going to dress ['the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh meat fade away', 'his', 'you', 'you', 'yourself'] in those clothes?” 
 
“There is no alternative, Master Ned.” 
 
“As ['you', 'sir', 'the harpooner', 'his', 'me', 'I', 'I'] please, ['you', 'sir', 'the harpooner', 'his', 'me', 'I', 'I'],” replied ['you', 'sir', 'the harpooner', 'his', 'me', 'I', 'I'], shrugging ['you', 'sir', 'the harpooner', 'his', 'me', 'I', 'I'] shoulders; “but as for ['you', 'sir', 'the harpooner', 'his', 'me', 'I', 'I'], unless ['you', 'sir', 'the harpooner', 'his', 'me', 'I', 'I'] am forced, ['you', 'sir', 'the harpooner', 'his', 'me', 'I', 'I'] will never get into one.” 
 
“No one will force ['you', 'Master Ned'], ['you', 'Master Ned'],” said Captain Nemo. 
 
“Is Conseil going to risk it?” asked Ned. 
 
“['I', 'my', 'Conseil'] follow ['I', 'my', 'Conseil'] master wherever he goes,” replied ['I', 'my', 'Conseil']. 
 
At the Captain’s call two of the ship’s crew came to help us to dress in ['these heavy and impervious clothes, made of india-rubber without seam, and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure', 'it', 'This suit', 'these consummate apparatuses']. One would have thought ['these heavy and impervious clothes, made of india-rubber without seam, and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure', 'it', 'This suit', 'these consummate apparatuses'] a suit of armour, both supple and resisting. ['these heavy and impervious clothes, made of india-rubber without seam, and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure', 'it', 'This suit', 'these consummate apparatuses'] formed ['trousers', 'The trousers'] and ['waistcoat', 'the waistcoat']. ['trousers', 'The trousers'] were finished off with thick boots, weighted with heavy leaden soles. The texture of ['waistcoat', 'the waistcoat'] was held together by bands of copper, which crossed ['the chest', 'it'], protecting ['the chest', 'it'] from the great pressure of the water, and leaving the lungs free to act; the sleeves ended in gloves, which in no way restrained the movement of the hands. There was a vast difference noticeable between ['these heavy and impervious clothes, made of india-rubber without seam, and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure', 'it', 'This suit', 'these consummate apparatuses'] and the old cork breastplates, jackets, and other contrivances in vogue during the eighteenth century. 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain’s'] and one of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain’s'] companions (a sort of Hercules, who must have possessed great strength), Conseil, and ['myself', 'I'], were soon enveloped in the dresses. There remained nothing more to be done but to enclose ['our', 'we'] heads in the metal box. But before proceeding to this operation, ['myself', 'I'] asked ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain’s'] permission to examine the guns ['our', 'we'] were to carry. 
 
One of the _Nautilus_ men gave me ['a simple gun, the butt end of whi['the butt end of which, made of steel, hollow in the centre', 'the butt end'], 'It', 'the gun']. ['a simple gun, the butt end of which, made of steel, hollow in the centre, was rather large', 'It', 'the gun'] served as a reservoir for compressed air, which a valve, worked by a spring, allowed to escape into a metal tube. A box of projectiles, in a groove in the thickness of ['the butt end of which, made of steel, hollow in the centre', 'the butt end'], contained about twenty of these electric balls, which, by means of a spring, were forced into the barrel of ['a simple gun, the butt end of which, made of steel, hollow in the centre, was rather large', 'It', 'the gun']. As soon as one shot was fired, another was ready. 
 
“Captain Nemo,” said ['I', 'I'], “['this arm', 'it'] is perfect, and easily handled: ['I', 'I'] only ask to be allowed to try ['this arm', 'it']. But how shall we gain the bottom of the sea?” 
 
“At this moment, Professor, the _Nautilus_ is stranded in five fathoms, and we have nothing to do but to start.” 
 
“But how shall we get off?” 
 
“You shall see.” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'his'] thrust ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] head into ['the helmet', 'the metal helmet'], ['Conseil and I', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'our'['I', 'my', 'I'] did the same, not without hearing an ironical “Good sport!” from the Canadian. The upper part of ['Conseil and I', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'ou['our dress', 'the head-dress'] terminated in a copper collar upon which was screwed ['the helmet', 'the metal helmet']. Three holes, protected by thick glass, allowed ['Conseil and I', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'our'] to see in all directions, by simply turning ['Conseil and I', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'ou['our head', 'it'] in the interior of ['our dress', 'the head-dress']. As soon as ['our head', 'it'] was in position, the Rouquayrol apparatus on ['Conseil and I', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'our'] backs began to act; and, for ['I', 'my', 'I'] part, ['I', 'my', 'I'] could breathe with ease. 
 
With the Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from ['my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me'] belt, and the gun in ['my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me'] hand, ['my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me'] was ready to set out. But to speak the truth, imprisoned in these heavy garments, and glued to the deck by ['my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me'] leaden soles, it was impossible for ['my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me'] to take a step. 
 
[Illustration] I was ready to set out 
 
But this state of things was provided for. ['I', 'myself', 'My', 'I'] felt ['I', 'myself', 'My', 'I'] being pushed into a little room contiguous to the wardrobe-room. ['I', 'myself', 'My', 'I'] companions followed, towed along in the same way. ['I', 'myself', 'My', 'I'] heard a water-tight door, furnished with stopper-plates, close upon ['us', 'we'], and ['us', 'we'] were wrapped in profound darkness. 
 
After some minutes, a loud hissing was heard. ['I', 'my', 'my'] felt the cold mount from ['I', 'my', 'my['my feet', 'our feet'] to ['I', 'my', 'my'] chest. Evidently from some part of ['the vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'] they had, by means of a tap, given entrance to the water, which was invading ['us', 'We', 'our'], and with which the room was soon filled. A second door cut in the side of ['the vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'] then opened. ['us', 'We', 'our'] saw a faint light. In another instant ['us', 'We', 'ou['my feet', 'our feet'] trod the bottom of the sea. 
 
And now, how can ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] retrace the impression left upon ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] by that walk under the waters? Words are impotent to relate such wonders! ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] walked in front, ['Captain Nemo', 'hi['his companion', 'Conseil'] followed some steps behind. ['his companion', 'Co['Conseil and I', 'our'['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] remained near each other, as if an exchange of words had been possible through ['Conseil and I', 'our'] metallic cases. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] no longer felt the weight of ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] clothing, or of ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] shoes, of ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] reservoir of air, or ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] thick helmet, in the midst of which ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my['my head', 'its'] rattled like an almond in ['my head', 'its'] shell. 
 
['The light, which lit the soil ['the soil thirty feet below the surface of the ocean', 'the watery mass', 'this water which surrou['the ocean', 'the sea'], astonished ['me', 'I', 'me', 'me'] by ['The light, which lit the soil thirty feet below the surface of the ocean', 'its'] power. The solar rays shone through ['the soil thirty feet below the surface of the ocean', 'the watery mass', 'this water which surrounded me'] easily, and dissipated all colour, and ['me', 'I', 'me', 'me'] clearly distinguished objects at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards. Beyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine, and faded into vague obscurity. Truly ['the soil thirty feet below the surface of the ocean', 'the watery mass', 'this water which surrounded me['me', 'I', 'me', 'me'] was but another air denser than the terrestrial atmosphere, but almost as transparent. Above ['me', 'I', 'me', 'me'] was the calm surface of ['the ocean', 'the sea']. 
 
We were walking on fine, even sand, not wrinkled, as on a flat shore, which retains the impression of the billows. This dazzling carpet, really a reflector, repelled the rays of the sun with wonderful intensity, which accounted for the vibration which penetrated every atom of liquid. Shall ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] be believed when ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] say that, at the depth of thirty feet, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could see as if ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was in broad daylight? 
 
For a quarter of an hour I trod on this sand, sown with the impalpable dust of shells. The hull of ['the _Nautilus_', 'its'], resembling a long shoal, disappeared by degrees; but ['the _Nautilus_', 'it['its lantern', 'its'], when darkness should overtake ['us', 'us'] in the waters, would help to guide ['us', 'us'] on board by ['its lantern', 'its'] distinct rays. 
 
Soon forms of objects outlined in the distance were discernible. ['I', 'I'] recognised magnificent rocks, hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the most beautiful kind, and ['I', 'I'] was at first struck by the peculiar effect of this medium. 
 
It was then ten in the morning; ['the rays of the sun', 'their'] struck the surface of the waves at rather an oblique angle, and at the touch of ['the rays of the sun', 'their'] light, decomposed by refraction as through a prism, flowers, rocks, plants, shells, and polypi were shaded at the edges by the seven solar colours. It was marvellous, a feast for the eyes, this complication of coloured tints, a perfect kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange, violet, indigo, and blue; in one word, the whole palette of an enthusiastic colourist! Why could ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] not communicate to ['Conseil', 'him'] the lively sensations which were mounting to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] brain, and rival ['Conseil', 'him'] in expressions of admiration? For aught ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] knew, ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] and ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] companion might be able to exchange thoughts by means of signs previously agreed upon. So, for want of better, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] talked to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my']; ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] declaimed in the copper box which covered ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] head, thereby expending more air in vain words than was perhaps expedient. 
 
Various kinds of isis, clusters of pure tuft-coral, prickly fungi, and anemones formed a brilliant garden of flowers, enamelled with porphitæ, decked with their collarettes of blue tentacles, sea-stars studding the sandy bottom, together with asterophytons like fine lace embroidered by the hands of naïads, whose festoons were waved by the gentle undulations caused by ['our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] walk. It was a real grief to ['me', 'my'] to crush under ['me', 'my'] feet the brilliant specimens of molluscs which strewed the ground by thousands, of hammer-heads, donaciae (veritable bounding shells), of staircases, and red helmet-shells, angel-wings, and many others produced by this inexhaustible ocean. But ['our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] were bound to walk, so ['our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] went on, whilst above ['our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] heads waved ['shoals of physalides leaving their tentacles to f['shoals of physalides leaving their tentacles to float in their train', 'their', 'their']in their train', 'their['shoals of physalides leaving their tentacles to float in their train', 'their', 'their']heir'], medusæ whose umbrellas of opal or rose-pink, escalloped with a band of blue, sheltered ['our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] from the rays of the sun and fiery pelagiæ, which, in the darkness, would have strewn ['our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] path with phosphorescent light. 
 
All these wonders ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] saw in the space of a quarter of a mile, scarcely stopping, and following Captain Nemo, who beckoned ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] on by signs. Soon the nature of the soil changed; to the sandy plain succeeded an extent of slimy mud, which the Americans call “ooze,” composed of equal parts of silicious and calcareous shells. ['We', 'our', 'our'] then travelled over ['a plain of sea-weed of wild and luxuriant vegetation', 'This sward']. ['a plain of sea-weed of wild and luxuriant vegetation', 'This sward'] was of close texture, and soft to the feet, and rivalled the softest carpet woven by the hand of man. But whilst ['verdure', 'it'] was spread at ['We', 'our', 'our'] feet, ['verdure', 'it'] did not abandon ['We', 'our', 'our'] heads. A light network of marine plants, of that inexhaustible family of sea-weeds of which more than two thousand kinds are known, grew on the surface of the water. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] saw long ribbons of fucus floating, some globular, others tuberous; laurenciæ and cladostephi of most delicate foliage, and some rhodomeniæ palmatæ, resembling the fan of a cactus. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] noticed that the green plants kept nearer the top of the sea, whilst the red were at a greater depth, leaving to the black or brown hydrophytes the care of forming gardens and parterres in the remote beds of the ocean. 
 
['We', 'We', 'We'] had quitted the _Nautilus_ about an hour and a half. It was near noon; I knew by the perpendicularity of the sun’s rays, which were no longer refracted. The magical colours disappeared by degrees, and the shades of emerald and sapphire were effaced. ['We', 'We', 'We'] walked with a regular step, which rang upon the ground with astonishing intensity; the slightest noise was transmitted with a quickness to which the ear is unaccustomed on ['the earth', 'the earth']; indeed, water is a better conductor of sound than air, in the ratio of four to one. At this period ['the earth', 'the earth'] sloped downwards; the light took a uniform tint. ['We', 'We', 'We'] were at a depth of a hundred and five yards and twenty inches, undergoing a pressure of six atmospheres. 
 
At this depth ['I', 'I'] could still see ['the rays of the sun', 'their'], though feebly; to ['the rays of the sun', 'their'] intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight, the lowest state between day and night; but we could still see well enough; it was not necessary to resort to the Ruhmkorff apparatus as yet. At this moment ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him'] stopped; ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him'] waited till ['I', 'I'] joined ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him'], and then pointed to an obscure mass, looming in the shadow, at a short distance. 
 
“It is the forest of the Island of Crespo,” thought I;—and I was not mistaken. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XVI A SUBMARINE FOREST 
 
We had at last arrived on the borders of ['this forest, doubtless one of the finest of Captain Nemo’s immense domains', 'it', 'i['Captain Nemo’s', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him']arine property']. ['Captain Nemo’s', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him'] looked upon ['this forest, doubtless one of the finest of Captain Nemo’s immense domains', 'it', 'it', 'this submarine property'] as ['Captain Nemo’s', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him'] own, and considered ['Captain Nemo’s', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him'] had the same right over ['this forest, doubtless one of the finest of Captain Nemo’s immense domains', 'it', 'it', 'this submarine property'] that the first men had in the first days of the world. And, indeed, who would have disputed with ['Captain Nemo’s', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him'] the possession of ['this forest, doubtless one of the finest of Captain Nemo’s immense domains', 'it', 'it', 'this submarine property']? What other hardier pioneer would come, hatchet in hand, to cut down the dark copses? 
 
['This forest', 'its', 'their'] was composed of large tree-plants; and the moment we penetrated under ['This forest', 'its', 'their'] vast arcades, ['I', 'I'] was struck by the singular position of ['This forest', 'its', 'their'] branches—a position ['I', 'I'] had not yet observed. 
 
Not a herb which carpeted the ground, not a branch which clothed ['the trees', 'they', 'all', 'they', 'The fuci and llianas', 'them', 'they', 'their'], was either broken or bent, nor did ['the trees', 'they', 'all', 'they', 'The fuci and llianas', 'them', 'they', 'their'] extend horizontally; ['the trees', 'they', 'all', 'they', 'The fuci and llianas', 'them', 'they', 'their'] stretched up to the surface of the ocean. Not a filament, not a ribbon, however thin ['the trees', 'they', 'all', 'they', 'The fuci and llianas', 'them', 'they', 'their'] might be, but kept as straight as a rod of iron. ['the trees', 'they', 'all', 'they', 'The fuci and llianas', 'them', 'they', 'their'] grew in rigid perpendicular lines, due to the density of the element which had produced ['the trees', 'they', 'all', 'they', 'The fuci and llianas', 'them', 'they', 'their']. Motionless, yet when bent to one side by the hand, ['the trees', 'they', 'all', 'they', 'The fuci and llianas', 'them', 'they', 'their'] directly resumed ['the trees', 'they', 'all', 'they', 'The fuci and llianas', 'them', 'they', 'their'] former position. Truly it was the region of perpendicularity! 
 
['I', 'myself', 'me', 'I'] soon accustomed ['I', 'myself', 'me', 'I'] to this fantastic position, as well as to the comparative darkness which surrounded us. The soil of the forest seemed covered with sharp blocks, difficult to avoid. ['The submarine flora', 'it'] struck ['I', 'myself', 'me', 'I'] as being very perfect, and richer even than ['The submarine flora', 'it'] would have been in the arctic or tropical zones, where these productions are not so plentiful. But for some minutes ['I', 'myself', 'me', 'I'] involuntarily confounded the genera, taking zoophytes for hydrophytes, animals for plants; and who would not have been mistaken? The fauna and the flora are too closely allied in this submarine world. 
 
['These plants', 'their', 'them'] are self-propagated, and the principle of ['These plants', 'their', 'them'] existence is in the water, which upholds and nourishes ['These plants', 'their', 'them']. The greater number, instead of leaves, shot forth blades of capricious shapes, comprised within a scale of colours,—pink, carmine, green, olive, fawn, and brown. I saw there (but not dried up, as our specimens of the _Nautilus_ are) pavonari spread like a fan, as if to catch the breeze; scarlet ceramies, whose laminaries extended their edible shoots of fern-shaped nereocysti, which grow to a height of fifteen feet; clusters of acetabuli, whose stems increase in size upwards; and numbers of other marine plants, all devoid of flowers! 
 
“Curious anomaly, fantastic element!” said an ingenious naturalist, “in which the animal kingdom blossoms, and the vegetable does not!” 
 
Under ['these numerous shrubs (as large as trees of the temperate zone)', 'their'], and under ['these numerous shrubs (as large as trees of the temperate zone)', 'their'] damp shadow, were massed together real bushes of living flowers, hedges of zoophytes, on which blossomed some zebrameandrines, with crooked grooves, some yellow caryophylliæ; and, to complete the allusion, the fish-flies flew from branch to branch like a swarm of humming-birds, whilst yellow lepisacomthi, with bristling jaws, dactylopteri, and monocentrides rose at our feet like a flight of snipes. 
 
In about an hour Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt. ['I', 'my'], for ['I', 'my'] part, was not sorry, and ['we', 'ourselves'] stretched ['we', 'ourselves'] under an arbour of alariæ, the long thin blades of which stood up like arrows. 
 
This short rest seemed delicious to ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I']; there was nothing wanting but the charm of conversation; but, impossible to speak, impossible to answer, ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] only put ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] great copper head to ['Conseil’s', 'the worthy fellow’s', 'his', 'he', 'himself', 'his']. ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] saw ['Conseil’s', 'the worthy fellow’s', 'his', 'he', 'himself', 'his'] eyes glistening with delight, and to show ['Conseil’s', 'the worthy fellow’s', 'his', 'he', 'himself', 'his'] satisfaction, ['Conseil’s', 'the worthy fellow’s', 'his', 'he', 'himself', 'his'] shook ['Conseil’s', 'the worthy fellow’s', 'his', 'he', 'himself', 'his'] in ['Conseil’s', 'the worthy fellow’s', 'his', 'he', 'himself', 'his'] breastplate of air in the most comical way in the world. 
 
After four hours of this walking ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] was surprised not to find ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] dreadfully hungry. How to account for this state of the stomach ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] could not tell. But instead ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] felt an insurmountable desire to sleep, which happens to all divers. And ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] eyes soon closed behind the thick glasses, and ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] fell into a heavy slumber, which the movement alone had prevented before. ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] and ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] robust companion, stretched in the clear crystal, set us the example. 
 
How long ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] remained buried in this drowsiness ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] cannot judge; but, when ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] woke, the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon. Captain Nemo had already risen, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] was beginning to stretch ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] limbs, when an unexpected apparition brought ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] briskly to ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] feet. 
 
A few steps off, ['a monstrous sea-spider, about thirty-eight inches high', 'this animal', 'the hideous crustacean, which a blow from the butt end of the gun knocked over', 'the monster'], was watching ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] with squinting eyes, ready to spring upon ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I']. Though ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I['my diver’s dress', 'my diving-dress'] was thick enough to defend ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] from the bite of ['a monstrous sea-spider, about thirty-eight inches high', 'this animal', 'the hideous crustacean, which a blow from the butt end of the gun knocked over', 'the monster'], ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] could not help shuddering with horror. Conseil and the sailor of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] awoke at this moment. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] pointed out ['a monstrous sea-spider, about thirty-eight inches high', 'this animal', 'the hideous crustacean, which a blow from the butt end of the gun knocked over', 'the monster'], and ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] saw the horrible claws of ['a monstrous sea-spider, about thirty-eight inches high', 'this animal', 'the hideous crustacean, which a blow from the butt end of the gun knocked over', 'the monster'] writhe in terrible convulsions. This accident reminded ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] that other animals more to be feared might haunt these obscure depths, against whose attacks ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I['my diver’s dress', 'my diving-dress'] would not protect ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I']. ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] had never thought of it before, but ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] now resolved to be upon ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] guard. Indeed, ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] thought that this halt would mark the termination of ['our', 'us', 'we', 'our', 'we'] walk; but ['me', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] was mistaken, for, instead of returning to ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'], ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] continued ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] bold excursion. ['The ground', 'its'] was still on the incline, ['The ground', 'its'] declivity seemed to be getting greater, and to be leading ['our', 'us', 'we', 'our', 'we'] to greater depths. It must have been about three o’clock when ['our', 'us', 'we', 'our', 'we'] reached a narrow valley, between high perpendicular walls, situated about seventy-five fathoms deep. Thanks to the perfection of ['our', 'us', 'we', 'our', 'we'] apparatus, ['our', 'us', 'we', 'our', 'we'] were forty-five fathoms below the limit which nature seems to have imposed on ['man', 'his'] as to ['man', 'his'] submarine excursions. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] say seventy-five fathoms, though ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] had no instrument by which to judge the distance. But ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] knew that even in the clearest waters the solar rays could not penetrate further. And accordingly the darkness deepened. At ten paces not an object was visible. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was groping ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] way, when ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] suddenly saw a brilliant white light. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his'] had just put ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his'] electric apparatus into use; ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his'] companion did the same, and ['Conseil and I', 'their', 'our'['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] followed ['Conseil and I', 'their', 'our'] example. By turning a screw ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] established a communication between the wire and the spiral glass, and the sea, lit by ['Conseil and I', 'their', 'our'] four lanterns, was illuminated for a circle of thirty-six yards. 
 
Captain Nemo was still plunging into the dark depths of the forest, whose trees were getting scarcer at every step. I noticed that vegetable life disappeared sooner than animal life. The medusæ had already abandoned the arid soil, from which a great number of animals, zoophytes, articulata, molluscs, and fishes, still obtained sustenance. 
 
As ['we', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'us all'] walked ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'], thought the light of ['we', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'us al['our Ruhmkorff apparatus', 'its'] could not fail to draw ['some inhabitant', 'they', 'they'] from ['our Ruhmkorff apparatus', 'its'] dark couch. But if ['some inhabitant', 'they', 'they'] did approach ['we', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'us all'], ['some inhabitant', 'they', 'they'] at least kept at a respectful distance from the hunters. Several times ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'he'] stop, put ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'h['his gun', 'it'] to ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'he'] shoulder, and after some moments drop ['his gun', 'it'] and walk on. At last, after about four hours, this marvellous excursion came to an end. ['A wall of superb rocks, in an imposing mass', 'it', 'It', 'the wall'], rose before ['we', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'us all'], a heap of gigantic blocks, an enormous, steep granite shore, forming dark grottos, but which presented no practicable slope; ['A wall of superb rocks, in an imposing mass', 'it', 'It', 'the wall'] was the prop of the Island of Crespo. ['A wall of superb rocks, in an imposing mass', 'it', 'It', 'the wall'] was the earth! ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'he'] stopped suddenly. A gesture of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'he'] brought ['we', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'us all'] to a halt, and, however desirous ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] might be to scale ['A wall of superb rocks, in an imposing mass', 'it', 'It', 'the wall'], ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was obliged to stop. Here ended ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s['Captain Nemo’s domains', 'them']. And ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'he'] would not go beyond ['Captain Nemo’s domains', 'them']. Further on was a portion of the globe ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'he'] might not trample upon. 
 
The return began. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain', 'his', 'He'] had returned to the head of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain', 'his', 'H['his little band', 'their'], directing ['his little band', 'their'] course without hesitation. ['I', 'I', 'I'] thought ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'us'] were not following ['the same road to return to the _Nautilus_', 'The new road']. ['the same road to return to the _Nautilus_', 'The new road'] was very steep, and consequently very painful. ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'us'] approached the surface of the sea rapidly. But this return to the upper strata was not so sudden as to cause relief from the pressure too rapidly, which might have produced serious disorder in ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'us'] organisation, and brought on internal lesions, so fatal to divers. Very soon light reappeared and grew, and the sun being low on the horizon, the refraction edged the different objects with a spectral ring. At ten yards and a half deep, ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'us'] walked amidst a shoal of little fishes of all kinds, more numerous than the birds of the air, and also more agile; but no aquatic game worthy of a shot had as yet met ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'us'] gaze, when at that moment ['I', 'I', 'I'] saw ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain', 'his', 'He'] shoulder ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain', 'his', 'He'] gun quickly, and follow a moving object into the shrubs. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain', 'his', 'He'] fired;—I heard a slight hissing, and ['a creature', 'It', 'This otter', 'Its', 'its'] fell stunned at some distance from ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'our', 'us']. ['a creature', 'It', 'This otter', 'Its', 'its'] was a magnificent sea-otter, an enhydrus, the only exclusively marine quadruped. ['a creature', 'It', 'This otter', 'Its', 'its'] was five feet long, and must have been very valuable. ['a creature', 'It', 'This otter', 'Its', 'its'] skin, chestnut-brown above and silvery underneath, would have made one of those beautiful furs so sought after in the Russian and Chinese markets; the fineness and the lustre of ['a creature', 'It', 'This otter', 'Its', 'its'] coat would certainly fetch £80. ['I', 'I', 'I'] admired this curious mammal, with ['its', 'its'] rounded head ornamented with short ears, ['its', 'its'] round eyes, and white whiskers like those of a cat, with webbed feet and nails, and tufted tail. ['This precious animal, hunted and tracked by fishermen', 'its'], has now become very rare, and taken refuge chiefly in the northern parts of the Pacific, or probably ['This precious animal, hunted and tracked by fishermen', 'its'] race would soon become extinct. 
 
['Captain Nemo’s companion', 'his'] took ['the beast', 'it'], threw ['the beast', 'it'] over ['Captain Nemo’s companion', 'his'] shoulder, and ['we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'our', 'us'] continued ['we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'our', 'us'] journey. For one hour ['a plain of sand', 'it'] lay stretched before ['we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'our', 'us']. Sometimes ['a plain of sand', 'it'] rose to within two yards and some inches of the surface of the water. I then saw ['we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'our', 'us'] image clearly reflected, drawn inversely, and above ['we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'our', 'us'] appeared ['an identical group reflecting our movements and our action['we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'our', 'us'] 'they', 'their['we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'our', 'us']'their']; in a word, like ['we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'our', 'us'] in every point, except that ['an identical group reflecting our movements and our actions', 'they', 'their', 'their'] walked with ['an identical group reflecting our movements and our actions', 'they', 'their', 'their'] heads downward and ['an identical group reflecting our movements and our actions', 'they', 'their', 'their'] feet in the air. 
 
Another effect ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] noticed, which was the passage of ['thick clouds which formed and vanished rapidly', 'these seeming clouds', 'their']; but on reflection ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] understood that ['thick clouds which formed and vanished rapidly', 'these seeming clouds', 'their'] were due to the varying thickness of the reeds at the bottom, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could even see the fleecy foam which ['thick clouds which formed and vanished rapidly', 'these seeming clouds', 'their'] broken tops multiplied on the water, and the shadows of large birds passing above our heads, whose rapid flight ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could discern on the surface of the sea. 
 
On this occasion, I was witness to one of the finest gun-shots which ever made the nerves of a hunter thrill. ['A large bird of great breadth of wing, clearly visible', 'The creature', 'its', 'it', 'It'], approached, hovering over us. ['Captain Nemo’s companion', 'his'] shouldered ['Captain Nemo’s companion', 'hi['his gun', 'it'] and fired, when ['his gun', 'it'] was only a few yards above the waves. ['A large bird of great breadth of wing, clearly visible', 'The creature', 'its', 'it', 'It'] fell stunned, and the force of ['A large bird of great breadth of wing, clearly visible', 'The creature', 'its', 'it', 'It'] fall brought ['A large bird of great breadth of wing, clearly visible', 'The creature', 'its', 'it', 'It'] within the reach of dexterous hunter’s grasp. ['A large bird of great breadth of wing, clearly visible', 'The creature', 'its', 'it', 'It'] was an albatross of the finest kind. 
 
['Our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] march had not been interrupted by this incident. For two hours ['Our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] followed these sandy plains, then fields of algæ very disagreeable to cross. Candidly, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] could do no more when ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] saw ['a glimmer of light, which, for a half mile, broke the darkness of the waters', 'It']. ['a glimmer of light, which, for a half mile, broke the darkness of the waters', 'It'] was the lantern of the _Nautilus_. Before twenty minutes were over ['Our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] should be on board, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] should be able to breathe with ease, for it seemed that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] reservoir supplied air very deficient in oxygen. But ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] did not reckon on an accidental meeting, which delayed ['Our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] arrival for some time. 
 
['I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me'] had remained some steps behind, when ['I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me'] presently saw ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain'] coming hurriedly towards ['I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me']. With ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain'] strong hand ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain'] bent ['I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me'] to the ground, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain'] companion doing the same to Conseil. At first ['I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me'] knew not what to think of this sudden attack, but ['I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me'] was soon reassured by seeing ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain'] lie down beside ['I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me'], and remain immovable. 
 
['I', 'my', 'I'] was stretched on the ground, just under the shelter of a bush of algæ, when, raising ['I', 'my', 'I'] head, ['I', 'my', 'I'] saw some enormous mass, casting phosphorescent gleams, pass blusteringly by. 
 
['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] blood froze in ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] veins as ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] recognised ['two formidable sharks which threatened us', 'It', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'their']. ['two formidable sharks which threatened us', 'It', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'their'] was a couple of tintoreas, terrible creatures, with enormous tails and a dull glassy stare, the phosphorescent matter ejected from holes pierced around the muzzle. Monstrous brutes! which would crush a whole man in ['two formidable sharks which threatened us', 'It', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'their'] iron jaws. ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] did not know whether Conseil stopped to classify ['two formidable sharks which threatened us', 'It', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'their']; for ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] part, ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] noticed ['two formidable sharks which threatened us', 'It', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'their'] silver bellies, and ['two formidable sharks which threatened us', 'It', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'their'] huge mouths bristling with teeth, from a very unscientific point of view, and more as a possible victim than as a naturalist. 
 
Happily ['the voracious creatures', 'They', 'their'] do not see well. ['the voracious creatures', 'They', 'their'] passed without seeing ['us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we'], brushing ['us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] with ['the voracious creatures', 'They', 'their'] brownish fins, and ['us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] escaped by a miracle from a danger certainly greater than meeting a tiger full-face in the forest. Half an hour after, guided by the electric light, ['us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] reached ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel']. ['The outside door', 'it'] had been left open, and ['Captain Nemo', 'He'] closed ['The outside door', 'it'] as soon as ['us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] had entered ['the first cell', 'the cell']. ['Captain Nemo', 'He'] then pressed a knob. ['I', 'I', 'me'] heard the pumps working in the midst of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel'], ['I', 'I', 'me'] felt the water sinking from around ['I', 'I', 'me'], and in a few moments ['the first cell', 'the cell'] was entirely empty. The inside door then opened, and ['us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] entered the vestry. 
 
There our diving-dress was taken off, not without some trouble; and, fairly worn out from want of food and sleep. ['I', 'my'] returned to ['I', 'my'] room, in great wonder at this surprising excursion at the bottom of the sea. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XVII FOUR THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE PACIFIC 
 
The next morning, the 18th of November, ['I', 'my', 'I'] had quite recovered from ['I', 'my', 'I'] fatigues of the day before, and ['I', 'my', 'I'] went up on to the platform, just as ['the second lieutenant', 'his'] was uttering ['the second lieutenant', 'his'] daily phrase. 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was admiring the magnificent aspect of ['the ocean', 'the ocean'] when ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he'] appeared. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he'] did not seem to be aware of ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] presence, and began a series of astronomical observations. Then, when ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he'] had finished, ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he'] went and leant on the cage of the watch-light, and gazed abstractedly on ['the ocean', 'the ocean']. In the meantime, ['a number of the sailors of the _Nautilus_, all strong and healthy men', 'They', 'These sailors', 'all of them', 'them'], had come up onto the platform. ['a number of the sailors of the _Nautilus_, all strong and healthy men', 'They', 'These sailors', 'all of them', 'them'] came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night. ['a number of the sailors of the _Nautilus_, all strong and healthy men', 'They', 'These sailors', 'all of them', 'them'] were evidently of different nations, although the European type was visible in ['a number of the sailors of the _Nautilus_, all strong and healthy men', 'They', 'These sailors', 'all of them', 'th['a number of the sailors of the _Nautilus_, all strong and healthy men', 'They', 'These sailors', 'all of them', 'them']. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] recognised ['some unmistakable Irishmen, Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote', 'They', 'themselves', 'them']. ['some unmistakable Irishmen, Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote', 'They', 'themselves', 'them'] were civil, and only used that odd language among ['some unmistakable Irishmen, Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote', 'They', 'themselves', 'them'], the origin of which ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could not guess, neither could ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] question ['some unmistakable Irishmen, Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote', 'They', 'themselves', 'them']. 
 
The nets were hauled in. ['They', 'These pockets, drawn by iron poles', 'their', 'they'] were a large kind of “chaluts,” like those on ['the Normandy coasts', 'those productive coasts'], great pockets that the waves and a chain fixed in the smaller meshes kept open. ['They', 'These pockets, drawn by iron poles', 'their', 'they'], swept through the water, and gathered in everything in ['They', 'These pockets, drawn by iron poles', 'their', 'they'] way. That day ['They', 'These pockets, drawn by iron poles', 'their', 'they'] brought up curious specimens from ['the Normandy coasts', 'those productive coasts']. 
 
I reckoned that ['the haul', 'It'] had brought in more than nine hundredweight of fish. ['the haul', 'It'] was a fine haul, but not to be wondered at. Indeed, ['the nets', 'their'] are let down for several hours, and enclose in ['the nets', 'their'] meshes an infinite variety. ['We', 'our'] had no lack of excellent food, and the rapidity of the _Nautilus_ and the attraction of the electric light could always renew ['We', 'our'] supply. These several productions of the sea were immediately lowered through the panel to the steward’s room, some to be eaten fresh, and others pickled. 
 
The fishing ended, the provision of air renewed, ['I', 'my', 'me'] thought that ['the _Nautilus_', 'its'] was about to continue ['the _Nautilus_', 'its'] submarine excursion, and was preparing to return to ['I', 'my', 'me'] room, when, without further preamble, the Captain turned to ['I', 'my', 'me'], saying: 
 
“['Professor', 'he', 'I'], is not ['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] gifted with real life? ['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] has ['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] tempers and ['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] gentle moods. Yesterday ['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] slept as we did, and now ['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] has woke after a quiet night. Look!” ['Professor', 'he', 'I'] continued, “['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] wakes under the caresses of the sun. ['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] is going to renew ['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] diurnal existence. It is an interesting study to watch the play of ['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] organisation. ['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] has a pulse, arteries, spasms; and ['Professor', 'he', 'I'] agree with the learned Maury, who discovered in ['this ocean', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It', 'it'] a circulation as real as the circulation of blood in animals. 
 
“Yes, ['the ocean', 'it'] has indeed ['circulation', 'it'], and to promote ['circulation', 'it'], the Creator has caused things to multiply in ['the ocean', 'it']—caloric, salt, and animalculae.” 
 
When ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] spoke thus, ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] seemed altogether changed, and aroused an extraordinary emotion in me. 
 
“Also,” ['he', 'I'] added, “true existence is there; and ['he', 'I'] can imagine the foundations of nautical towns, clusters of submarine houses, which, like the _Nautilus_, would ascend every morning to breathe at the surface of the water, free towns, independent cities. Yet who knows whether some despot——” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'his'] finished ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] sentence with a violent gesture. Then, addressing me as if to chase away some sorrowful thought: 
 
“['M. Aronnax', 'you'],” he asked, “do ['M. Aronnax', 'you'] know the depth of the ocean?” 
 
“I only know, Captain, what the principal soundings have taught us.” 
 
“Could you tell ['me', 'I', 'my'] ['them', 'them'], so that ['me', 'I', 'my'] can suit ['them', 'them'] to ['me', 'I', 'my'] purpose?” 
 
“These are some,” ['I', 'I', 'I'] replied, “that ['I', 'I', 'I'] remember. If ['I', 'I', 'I'] am not mistaken, a depth of 8,000 yards has been found in the North Atlantic, and 2,500 yards in the Mediterranean. ['The most remarkable soundings', 'they'] have been made in the South Atlantic, near the thirty-fifth parallel, and ['The most remarkable soundings', 'they'] gave 12,000 yards, 14,000 yards, and 15,000 yards. To sum up all, it is reckoned that if the bottom of ['the sea', 'its'] were levelled, ['the sea', 'its'] mean depth would be about one and three-quarter leagues.” 
 
“Well, ['Professor', 'you', 'you'],” replied ['the Captain', 'I', 'I'], “we shall show ['Professor', 'you', 'you'] better than that ['the Captain', 'I', 'I'] hope. As to ['the mean depth of this part of the Pacific', 'it'], ['the Captain', 'I', 'I'] tell ['Professor', 'you', 'you'] ['the mean depth of this part of the Pacific', 'it'] is only 4,000 yards.” 
 
Having said this, ['Captain Nemo', 'him'] went towards the panel, and disappeared down the ladder. I followed ['Captain Nemo', 'him'], and went into the large drawing-room. The screw was immediately put in motion, and the log gave twenty miles an hour. 
 
During the days and weeks that passed, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The lieutenant'] was very sparing of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The lieutenant'] visits. ['I', 'I'] seldom saw ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The lieutenant']. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The lieutenant'] pricked ['the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_'] course regularly on the chart, so ['I', 'I'] could always tell exactly the route of ['the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_']. 
 
Nearly every day, for some time, the panels of the drawing-room were opened, and we were never tired of penetrating the mysteries of the submarine world. 
 
The general direction of ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] was south-east, and ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] kept between 100 and 150 yards of depth. One day, however, I do not know why, being drawn diagonally by means of the inclined planes, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] touched the bed of the sea. The thermometer indicated a temperature of 4.25 (cent.): a temperature that at this depth seemed common to all latitudes. 
 
At three o’clock in the morning of the 26th of November ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the ship', 'the _Nautilus_'] crossed the tropic of Cancer at 172° long. On 27th instant ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the ship', 'the _Nautilus_'] sighted the Sandwich Islands, where Cook died, February 14, 1779. ['We', 'our', 'we', 'us'] had then gone 4,860 leagues from ['We', 'our', 'we', 'us'] starting-point. In the morning, when ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] went on the platform, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw two miles to windward, Hawaii, the largest of the seven islands that form ['the group', 'the group that belongs to France']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw clearly the cultivated ranges, and the several mountain-chains that run parallel with the side, and the volcanoes that overtop Mouna-Rea, which rise 5,000 yards above the level of the sea. Besides other things ['the nets', 'the nets'] brought up, were several flabellariae and graceful polypi, that are peculiar to that part of the ocean. The direction of ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the ship', 'the _Nautilus_'] was still to the south-east. ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the ship', 'the _Nautilus_'] crossed the equator December 1, in 142° long.; and on ['the 4th of the same month', 'the 4th'], after crossing rapidly and without anything in particular occurring, ['We', 'our', 'we', 'us'] sighted the Marquesas group. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw, three miles off, Martin’s peak in Nouka-Hiva, the largest of ['the group', 'the group that belongs to France']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] only saw the woody mountains against the horizon, because Captain Nemo did not wish to bring ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the ship', 'the _Nautilus_'] to the wind. There ['the nets', 'the nets'] brought up beautiful specimens of fish: some with azure fins and tails like gold, the flesh of which is unrivalled; some nearly destitute of scales, but of exquisite flavour; others, with bony jaws, and yellow-tinged gills, as good as bonitos; all fish that would be of use to ['We', 'our', 'we', 'us']. After leaving these charming islands protected by the French flag, from ['the 4th of the same month', 'the 4th'] to the 11th of December ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the ship', 'the _Nautilus_'] sailed over about 2,000 miles. 
 
During the daytime of the 11th of December I was busy reading in the large drawing-room. Ned Land and Conseil watched the luminous water through the half-open panels. ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it'] was immovable. While ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it'] reservoirs were filled, ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it'] kept at a depth of 1,000 yards, a region rarely visited in the ocean, and in which large fish were seldom seen. 
 
['I', 'I', 'me'] was then reading ['a charming book by Jean Mace, The Slaves of the Stomach', 'it'], and ['I', 'I', 'me'] was learning some valuable lessons from ['a charming book by Jean Mace, The Slaves of the Stomach', 'it'], when Conseil interrupted ['I', 'I', 'me']. 
 
“Will master come here a moment?” he said, in a curious voice. 
 
“What is the matter, Conseil?” 
 
“I want master to look.” 
 
['I', 'my'] rose, went, and leaned on ['I', 'my'] elbows before the panes and watched. 
 
In a full electric light, ['an enormous black mass, quite immovable', 'it', 'this gigantic cetacean'], was suspended in the midst of the waters. ['I', 'my', 'I'] watched ['an enormous black mass, quite immovable', 'it', 'this gigantic cetacean'] attentively, seeking to find out the nature of ['an enormous black mass, quite immovable', 'it', 'this gigantic cetacean']. But a sudden thought crossed ['I', 'my', 'I'] mind. “A vessel!” ['I', 'my', 'I'] said, half aloud. 
 
“Yes,” replied the Canadian, “a disabled ship that has sunk perpendicularly.” 
 
Ned Land was right; we were close to ['a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains', 'it', 'the vessel', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel']. The keel seemed to be in good order, and ['a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains', 'it', 'the vessel', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel'] had been wrecked at most some few hours. Three stumps of masts, broken off about two feet above ['the bridge', 'the bridge, where some corpses, bound with ropes, were still lying'], showed that ['a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains', 'it', 'the vessel', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel'] had had to sacrifice ['a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains', 'it', 'the vessel', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the vesse['its masts', 'the three broken masts']. But, lying on ['a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains', 'it', 'the vessel', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel'] side, ['a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains', 'it', 'the vessel', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel'] had filled, and ['a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains', 'it', 'the vessel', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel'] was heeling over to port. ['This skeleton of what it had o['a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains', 'it', 'the vessel', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel']e been', 'it'] was a sad spectacle as ['This skeleton of what it had once been', 'it'] lay lost under the waves, but sadder still was the sight of ['the bridge', 'the bridge, where some corpses, bound with ropes, were still lying']. ['I', 'I'] counted five—['four men', 'the four sailors', 'they', 'their', 'themselves', 'them'], one of whom was standing at ['the helm', 'the helm'], and ['a woman standing by the poop, holding an infant in her arms', 'her', 'She', 'her',['an infant', 'her infant', 'its']her'['a woman standing by the poop, holding an infant in her arms', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'she', 'her', 'her']her']. ['a woman standing by the poop, holding an infant in her arms', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'she', 'her', 'her'] was quite young. ['I', 'I'] could distinguish ['a woman standing by the poop, holding an infant in her arms', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'she', 'her', 'her'] features, which the water had not decomposed, by the brilliant light from the _Nautilus_. In one despairing effort, ['a woman standing by the poop, holding an infant in her arms', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'she', 'her', 'her'] had raised ['a woman standing by the poop, holding an infant in her arms', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'she', 'her', 'he['an infant', 'her infant', 'its'] above ['a woman standing by the poop, holding an infant in her arms', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'she', 'her', 'her'] head—poor little thing!—whose arms encircled ['an infant', 'her infant', 'its'] mother’s neck. The attitude of ['four men', 'the four sailors', 'they', 'their', 'themselves', 'them'] was frightful, distorted as ['four men', 'the four sailors', 'they', 'their', 'themselves', 'them'] were by ['four men', 'the four sailors', 'they', 'their', 'themselves', 'them'] convulsive movements, whilst making a last effort to free ['four men', 'the four sailors', 'they', 'their', 'themselves', 'them'] from the cords that bound ['four men', 'the four sailors', 'they', 'their', 'themselves', 'them'] to ['a vessel of which the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains', 'it', 'the vessel', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the vessel']. The steersman alone, calm, with a grave, clear face, ['his', 'his', 'his'] grey hair glued to ['his', 'his', 'his'] forehead, and ['his', 'his', 'his'] hand clutching the wheel of ['the helm', 'the helm'], seemed even then to be guiding ['its masts', 'the three broken masts'] through the depths of the ocean. 
 
What a scene! ['We', 'our'] were dumb; ['We', 'our'] hearts beat fast before ['this shipwreck, taken as it were from life and['this shipwreck, taken as it were from life and photographed in its last moments', 'it', 'its', 'it']hotographed in its last moments', 'i['this shipwreck, taken as it were from life and photographed in its last moments', 'it', 'its', 'it'] 'its', 'it']. And I saw already, coming towards ['this shipwreck, taken as it were from life and photographed in its last moments', 'it', 'its', 'it'] with hungry eyes, enormous sharks, attracted by the human flesh. 
 
However, the _Nautilus_, turning, went round the submerged vessel, and in one instant I read on the stern—“The Florida, Sunderland.” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XVIII VANIKORO 
 
This terrible spectacle was the forerunner of the series of maritime catastrophes that ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it'] was destined to meet with in ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it'] route. As long as ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it'] went through more frequented waters, ['we', 'we'] often saw the hulls of shipwrecked vessels that were rotting in the depths, and deeper down cannons, bullets, anchors, chains, and a thousand other iron materials eaten up by rust. However, on the 11th of December ['we', 'we'] sighted the Pomotou Islands, the old “dangerous group” of Bougainville, that extend over a space of 500 leagues at E.S.E. to W.N.W., from the Island Ducie to that of Lazareff. ['This group', 'it', 'this new island'] covers an area of 370 square leagues, and ['This group', 'it', 'this new island'] is formed of ['sixty groups of islands, among which the Gambier group is remarkable, over which France exercises sway', 'These']. ['sixty groups of islands, among which the Gambier group is remarkable, over which France exercises sway', 'These'] are coral islands, slowly raised, but continuous, created by the daily work of polypi. Then ['This group', 'it', 'this new island'] will be joined later on to the neighboring groups, and a fifth continent will stretch from New Zealand and New Caledonia, and from thence to the Marquesas. 
 
One day, when I was suggesting this theory to ['Captain Nemo', 'he'], ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] replied coldly: 
 
“The earth does not want new continents, but new men.” 
 
Chance had conducted the _Nautilus_ towards the Island of Clermont-Tonnere, one of the most curious of the group, that was discovered in 1822 by Captain Bell of the Minerva. I could study now the madreporal system, to which are due the islands in this ocean. 
 
['Madrepores (which must not be mistaken for corals)', 'them'] have ['a tissue lined with a calcareous crust', 'its'], and the modifications of ['a tissue lined with a calcareous crust', 'its'] structure have induced M. Milne Edwards, my worthy master, to class ['Madrepores (which must not be mistaken for corals)', 'them'] into five sections. The animalcule that ['the marine polypus', 'their', 'Their', 'they', 'they', 'they'] secretes live by millions at the bottom of ['the marine polypus', 'their', 'Their', 'they', 'they', 'they'] cells. ['the marine polypus', 'their', 'Their', 'they', 'they', 'they'] calcareous deposits become rocks, reefs, and large and small islands. Here ['the marine polypus', 'their', 'Their', 'they', 'they', 'they'] form a ring, surrounding a little inland lake, that communicates with the sea by means of gaps. There ['the marine polypus', 'their', 'Their', 'they', 'they', 'they'] make barriers of reefs like those on the coasts of New Caledonia and the various Pomoton islands. In other places, like those at Reunion and at Maurice, ['the marine polypus', 'their', 'Their', 'they', 'they', 'they'] raise fringed reefs, high, straight walls, near which the depth of the ocean is considerable. 
 
Some cable-lengths off the shores of the Island of Clermont ['I', 'my'] admired the gigantic work accomplished by ['these microscopical workers', 'those madrepores known as milleporas, porites, madrepores, and astraeas', 'These polypi', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'themselves', 'them']. These walls are specially the work of ['these microscopical workers', 'those madrepores known as milleporas, porites, madrepores, and astraeas', 'These polypi', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'themselves', 'them']. ['these microscopical workers', 'those madrepores known as milleporas, porites, madrepores, and astraeas', 'These polypi', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'themselves', 'them'] are found particularly in the rough beds of ['the sea', 'the sea'], near the surface; and consequently it is from the upper part that ['these microscopical workers', 'those madrepores known as milleporas, porites, madrepores, and astraeas', 'These polypi', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'themselves', 'them'] begin ['these microscopical workers', 'those madrepores known as milleporas, porites, madrepores, and astraeas', 'These polypi', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'themselves', 'them'] operations, in which ['these microscopical workers', 'those madrepores known as milleporas, porites, madrepores, and astraeas', 'These polypi', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'themselves', 'them'] bury ['these microscopical workers', 'those madrepores known as milleporas, porites, madrepores, and astraeas', 'These polypi', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'themselves', 'them'] by degrees with the debris of the secretions that support ['these microscopical workers', 'those madrepores known as milleporas, porites, madrepores, and astraeas', 'These polypi', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'themselves', 'them']. Such is, at least, Darwin’s theory, who thus explains the formation of the _atolls_, a superior theory (to ['I', 'my'] mind) to that given of the foundation of the madreporical works, summits of mountains or volcanoes, that are submerged some feet below the level of ['the sea', 'the sea']. 
 
['I', 'me', 'I'] could observe closely ['these curious walls', 'they', 'these colossal barriers'], for perpendicularly ['these curious walls', 'they', 'these colossal barriers'] were more than 300 yards deep, and our electric sheets lighted up this calcareous matter brilliantly. Replying to a question ['Conseil', 'him', 'him'] asked ['I', 'me', 'I'] as to the time ['these curious walls', 'they', 'these colossal barriers'] took to be raised, ['I', 'me', 'I'] astonished ['Conseil', 'him', 'him'] much by telling ['Conseil', 'him', 'him'] that learned men reckoned it about the eighth of an inch in a hundred years. 
 
Towards evening Clermont-Tonnerre was lost in the distance, and the route of ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] was sensibly changed. After having crossed the tropic of Capricorn in 135° longitude, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] sailed W.N.W., making again for the tropical zone. Although the summer sun was very strong, we did not suffer from heat, for at fifteen or twenty fathoms below the surface, the temperature did not rise above from ten to twelve degrees. 
 
On 15th of December, ['we', 'our'] left to the east the bewitching group of the Societies and the graceful Tahiti, queen of the Pacific. I saw in the morning, some miles to the windward, ['the elevated summits of the island', 'These waters']. ['the elevated summits of the island', 'These waters'] furnished ['we', 'our'] table with excellent fish, mackerel, bonitos, and some varieties of a sea-serpent. 
 
On the 25th of December ['the _Nautilus_', 'its'] sailed into the midst of the New Hebrides, discovered by Quiros in 1606, and that Bougainville explored in 1768, and to which Cook gave ['the _Nautilus_', 'its'] present name in 1773. This group is composed principally of nine large islands, that form a band of 120 leagues N.N.S. to S.S.W., between 15° and 2° S. lat., and 164 deg. and 168° long. We passed tolerably near to the Island of Aurou, that at noon looked like a mass of green woods, surmounted by a peak of great height. 
 
That day being Christmas Day, Ned Land seemed to regret sorely the non-celebration of “Christmas,” the family fete of which Protestants are so fond. ['I', 'I', 'me'] had not seen ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'The Captain', 'his'] for a week, when, on the morning of the 27th, ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'The Captain', 'his'] came into the large drawing-room, always seeming as if ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'The Captain', 'his'] had seen you five minutes before. ['I', 'I', 'me'] was busily tracing the route of the _Nautilus_ on the planisphere. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'The Captain', 'his'] came up to ['I', 'I', 'me'], put ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'The Captain', 'his'] finger on one spot on the chart, and said this single word. 
 
“Vanikoro.” 
 
The effect was magical! It was the name of the islands on which La Perouse had been lost! I rose suddenly. 
 
“The _Nautilus_ has brought us to Vanikoro?” I asked. 
 
“Yes, Professor,” said the Captain. 
 
“And I can visit the celebrated islands where the Boussole and the Astrolabe struck?” 
 
“If ['you', 'Professor'] like, ['you', 'Professor'].” 
 
“When shall we be there?” 
 
“We are there now.” 
 
Followed by Captain Nemo, I went up on to the platform, and greedily scanned the horizon. 
 
To the N.E. two volcanic islands emerged of unequal size, surrounded by a coral reef that measured forty miles in circumference. ['We', 'our'] were close to Vanikoro, really the one to which Dumont d’Urville gave the name of Isle de la Recherche, and exactly facing the little harbour of Vanou, situated in 16° 4′ S. lat., and 164° 32′ E. long. The earth seemed covered with verdure from the shore to the summits in the interior, that were crowned by Mount Kapogo, 476 feet high. ['The _Nautilus_', 'itself'], having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait, found ['The _Nautilus_', 'itself'] among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty fathoms deep. Under the verdant shade of some mangroves I perceived ['some savages, who appeared greatly surprised at our approach', 'th['We', 'our'], 'they']. In the long black body, moving between wind and water, did ['some savages, who appeared greatly surprised at our approach', 'they', 'they'] not see some formidable cetacean that ['some savages, who appeared greatly surprised at our approach', 'they', 'they'] regarded with suspicion? 
 
Just then Captain Nemo asked ['me', 'I'] what ['me', 'I'] knew about the wreck of La Perouse. 
 
“Only what everyone knows, Captain,” I replied. 
 
“And could ['you', 'me', 'he'] tell ['you', 'me', 'he'] what everyone knows about it?” ['you', 'me', 'he'] inquired, ironically. 
 
“Easily.” 
 
I related to him all that the last works of Dumont d’Urville had made known—works from which the following is a brief account. 
 
['La Perouse', 'his'], and ['La Perouse', 'his'] second, Captain de Langle, were sent by Louis XVI, in 1785, on a voyage of circumnavigation. They embarked in ['the corvettes Boussole and the Astrolabe, neither of which were again heard of', 'these two sloops']. In 1791, the French Government, justly uneasy as to the fate of ['the corvettes Boussole and the Astrolabe, neither of which were again heard of', 'these two sloops'], manned two large merchantmen, the Recherche and the Esperance, which left Brest the 28th of September under the command of Bruni d’Entrecasteaux. 
 
Two months after, they ['learned', 'this communication'] from Bowen, commander of the Albemarle, that the debris of shipwrecked vessels had been seen on the coasts of New Georgia. But ['D’Entrecasteaux', 'his'], ignoring ['learned', 'this communication']—rather uncertain, besides—directed ['D’Entrecasteaux', 'his'] course towards the Admiralty Islands, mentioned in a report of Captain Hunter’s as being the place where La Perouse was wrecked. 
 
They sought in vain. The Esperance and the Recherche passed before Vanikoro without stopping there, and, in fact, ['this voyage', 'it'] was most disastrous, as ['this voyage', 'it'] cost ['D’Entrecasteaux', 'his', 'his', 'his'] ['D’Entrecasteaux', 'his', 'his', 'his'] life, and those of two of ['D’Entrecasteaux', 'his', 'his', 'his'] lieutenants, besides several of ['D’Entrecasteaux', 'his', 'his', 'his'] crew. 
 
['Captain Dillon, a shrewd old Pacific sailor', 'his', 'him'], was the first to find unmistakable traces of the wrecks. On the 15th of May, 1824, ['Captain Dillon, a shrewd old Pacific sailor', 'his', 'him'] vessel, the St. Patrick, passed close to Tikopia, one of the New Hebrides. There ['a Lascar', 'The Lascar', 'he'] came alongside in a canoe, sold ['Captain Dillon, a shrewd old Pacific sailor', 'his', 'him'] the handle of a sword in silver that bore the print of characters engraved on the hilt. ['a Lascar', 'The Lascar', 'he'] pretended that six years before, during a stay at Vanikoro, ['a Lascar', 'The Lascar', 'he'] had seen two Europeans that belonged to some vessels that had run aground on the reefs some years ago. 
 
['Dillon', 'He', 'he', 'him'] guessed that he meant La Perouse, whose disappearance had troubled the whole world. ['Dillon', 'He', 'he', 'him'] tried to get on to Vanikoro, where, according to the Lascar, ['Dillon', 'He', 'he', 'him'] would find numerous debris of the wreck, but winds and tides prevented ['Dillon', 'He', 'he', 'him']. 
 
['Dillon', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he'] returned to Calcutta. There ['Dillon', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he'] interested the Asiatic Society and the Indian Company in ['Dillon', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he'] discovery. A vessel, to which was given the name of the Recherche, was put at ['Dillon', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he'] disposal, and ['Dillon', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he'] set out, 23rd January, 1827, accompanied by a French agent. 
 
The Recherche, after touching at several points in the Pacific, cast anchor before Vanikoro, 7th July, 1827, in that same harbour of Vanou where the _Nautilus_ was at this time. 
 
There it collected numerous relics of the wreck—iron utensils, anchors, pulley-strops, swivel-guns, an 18 lbs. shot, fragments of astronomical instruments, a piece of crown work, and a bronze clock, bearing this inscription—“Bazin m’a fait,” the mark of the foundry of the arsenal at Brest about 1785. There could be no further doubt. 
 
['Dillon', 'he', 'his', 'he'], having made all inquiries, stayed in the unlucky place till October. Then ['Dillon', 'he', 'his', 'he'] quitted Vanikoro, and directed ['Dillon', 'he', 'his', 'he'] course towards New Zealand; put into Calcutta, 7th April, 1828, and returned to France, where ['Dillon', 'he', 'his', 'he'] was warmly welcomed by Charles X. 
 
But at the same time, without knowing ['Dillon’s', 'Dillon', 'he', 'Dillon’s', 'Dillon’s'] movements, ['Dumont d’Urville', 'Dumont d’Urville, commander of the Astrolabe', 'he', 'Dumont d’Urville'] had already set out to find the scene of the wreck. And they had learned from a whaler that some medals and a cross of St. Louis had been found in the hands of some savages of Louisiade and New Caledonia. ['Dumont d’Urville', 'Dumont d’Urville, commander of the Astrolabe', 'he', 'Dumont d’Urville'], had then sailed, and two months after ['Dillon’s', 'Dillon', 'he', 'Dillon’s', 'Dillon’s'] had left Vanikoro ['Dillon’s', 'Dillon', 'he', 'Dillon’s', 'Dillon’s'] put into Hobart Town. There ['Dumont d’Urville', 'Dumont d’Urville, commander of the Astrolabe', 'he', 'Dumont d’Urville'] learned the results of ['Dillon’s', 'Dillon', 'he', 'Dillon’s', 'Dillon’s'] inquiries, and found that a certain James Hobbs, second lieutenant of the Union of Calcutta, after landing on an island situated 8° 18′ S. lat., and 156° 30′ E. long., had seen some iron bars and red stuffs used by the natives of these parts. ['Dumont d’Urville', 'Dumont d’Urville, commander of the Astrolabe', 'he', 'Dumont d’Urville'], much perplexed, and not knowing how to credit the reports of low-class journals, decided to follow ['Dillon’s', 'Dillon', 'he', 'Dillon’s', 'Dillon’s'] track. 
 
On the 10th of February, 1828, ['the Astrolabe', 'his', 'he'] appeared off ['Tikopia', 'the island'], and took as guide and interpreter a deserter found on ['Tikopia', 'the island']; made ['the Astrolabe', 'his', 'he'] way to ['Vanikoro', 'it'], sighted ['Vanikoro', 'it'] on the 12th inst., lay among the reefs until the 14th, and not until the 20th did ['the Astrolabe', 'his', 'he'] cast anchor within the barrier in the harbour of Vanou. 
 
On the 23rd, several officers went round the island and brought back ['some unimportant trifles', 'them', 'the castaways']. ['The natives', 'them', 'the natives', 'they'], adopting a system of denials and evasions, ['refused', 'This ambiguous conduct'] to take ['some unimportant trifles', 'them', 'the castaways'] to the unlucky place. ['refused', 'This ambiguous conduct'] led ['The natives', 'them', 'the natives', 'they'] to believe that ['The natives', 'them', 'the natives', 'they'] had ill-treated ['some unimportant trifles', 'them', 'the castaways'], and indeed ['The natives', 'them', 'the natives', 'they'] seemed to fear that Dumont d’Urville had come to avenge ['La Perouse', 'his'] and ['La Perouse', 'his'] unfortunate crew. 
 
However, on the 26th, appeased by some presents, and understanding that ['they', 'they'] had no reprisals to fear, ['they', 'they'] led M. Jacquireot to the scene of the wreck. 
 
There, in three or four fathoms of water, between the reefs of Pacou and Vanou, lay anchors, cannons, pigs of lead and iron, embedded in the limy concretions. ['The large boat and the whaler belonging to the Astrolabe', 'their'] were sent to this place, and, not without some difficulty, ['The large boat and the whaler belonging to the Astrolabe', 'their'] crews hauled up an anchor weighing 1,800 lbs., a brass gun, some pigs of iron, and two copper swivel-guns. 
 
Dumont d’Urville, questioning the natives, learned too that ['La Perouse', 'his'], after losing both ['La Perouse', 'his'] vessels on the reefs of this island, had constructed a smaller boat, only to be lost a second time. Where, no one knew. 
 
But the French Government, fearing that Dumont d’Urville was not acquainted with Dillon’s movements, had sent ['the sloop Bayonnaise, commanded by Legoarant de Tromelin,', 'The Bayonnaise', 'her'] to ['Vanikoro, which had been stationed on the west coast of America', 'Vanikoro']. ['the sloop Bayonnaise, commanded by Legoarant de Tromelin,', 'The Bayonnaise', 'her'] cast ['the sloop Bayonnaise, commanded by Legoarant de Tromelin,', 'The Bayonnaise', 'her'] anchor before ['Vanikoro, which had been stationed on the west coast of America', 'Vanikoro'] some months after the departure of the Astrolabe, but found no new document; but stated that the savages had respected the monument to La Perouse. That is the substance of what I told Captain Nemo. 
 
“So,” he said, “no one knows now where the third vessel perished that was constructed by the castaways on the island of Vanikoro?” 
 
“No one knows.” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'him'] said nothing, but signed to me to follow ['Captain Nemo', 'him'] into the large saloon. The _Nautilus_ sank several yards below the waves, and the panels were opened. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I'] hastened to the aperture, and under the crustations of coral, covered with fungi, syphonules, alcyons, madrepores, through myriads of charming fish—girelles, glyphisidri, pompherides, diacopes, and holocentres—['I', 'I', 'I'] recognised certain debris that the drags had not been able to tear up—iron stirrups, anchors, cannons, bullets, capstan fittings, the stem of a ship, all objects clearly proving the wreck of some vessel, and now carpeted with living flowers. While ['I', 'I', 'I'] was looking on this desolate scene, Captain Nemo said, in a sad voice: 
 
“['Commander La Perouse', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'La Perouse'] set out 7th December, 1785, with ['Commander La Perouse', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'La Perous['his vessels La Boussole and the Astrolabe', '['the Astrolabe', 'The Astrolabe']. ['Commander La Perouse', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'La Perouse'] first cast anchor at Botany Bay, visited the Friendly Isles, New Caledonia, then directed ['Commander La Perouse', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'La Perouse'] course towards Santa Cruz, and put into Namouka, one of ['the Hapai group', 'the group']. Then ['Commander La Perouse', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'La Perous['his vessels La Boussole and the Astrolabe', 'his vessels'] struck on the unknown reefs of ['Vanikoro', 'the island', 'Vanikoro']. ['The Boussole, which went first', 'its', 'The first vessel'], ran aground on the southerly coast. ['the Astrolabe', 'The Astrolabe'] went to ['The Boussole, which went first', 'its', 'The first vessel'] help, and ran aground too. ['The Boussole, which went first', 'its', 'The first vessel'] was destroyed almost immediately. The second, stranded under the wind, resisted some days. The natives made ['the castaways', 'They', 'themselves'] welcome. ['the castaways', 'They', 'themselves'] installed ['the castaways', 'They', 'themselves'] in ['Vanikoro', 'the island', 'Vanikoro'], and constructed a smaller boat with the debris of the two large ones. Some sailors stayed willingly at ['Vanikoro', 'the island', 'Vanikoro']; ['the others, weak and ill', 'They', 'their'], set out with ['Commander La Perouse', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'La Perouse']. ['the others, weak and ill', 'They', 'their'] directed ['the others, weak and ill', 'They', 'their'] course towards the Solomon Islands, and there perished, with everything, on the westerly coast of the chief island of ['the Hapai group', 'the group'], between Capes Deception and Satisfaction.” 
 
“How do you know that?” 
 
“By this, that I found on the spot where was the last wreck.” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'He'] showed ['me', 'I'] ['a tin-plate box, stamped with the French arms, and corroded by the salt water', 'it']. ['Captain Nemo', 'He'] opened ['a tin-plate box, stamped with the French arms, and corroded by the salt water', 'it'], and ['me', 'I'] saw a bundle of papers, yellow but still readable. 
 
They were the instructions of the naval minister to Commander La Perouse, annotated in the margin in Louis XVI’s handwriting. 
 
“Ah! it is a fine death for a sailor!” said ['Captain Nemo', 'I', 'I', 'my'], at last. “A coral tomb makes a quiet grave; and ['Captain Nemo', 'I', 'I', 'my'] trust that ['Captain Nemo', 'I', 'I', 'my'] and ['Captain Nemo', 'I', 'I', 'my'] comrades will find no other.” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XIX TORRES STRAITS 
 
During the night of the 27th or 28th of December, ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'she', 'it'] left the shores of Vanikoro with great speed. ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'she', 'it'] course was south-westerly, and in three days ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'she', 'it'] had gone over the 750 leagues that separated ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'she', 'it'] from La Perouse’s group and the south-east point of Papua. 
 
Early on the 1st of January, 1863, Conseil joined me on the platform. 
 
“['Master', 'you', 'you'], will ['Master', 'you', 'you'] permit me to wish ['Master', 'you', 'you'] a happy New Year?” 
 
“What! Conseil; exactly as if ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] was at Paris in ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] study at the Jardin des Plantes? Well, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] accept ['your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'y['your good wishes', 'them'], and thank ['your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] for ['your good wishes', 'them']. Only, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] will ask ['your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] what ['your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] mean by a ‘Happy New Year’ under ['our', 'us', 'our', 'us'] circumstances? Do ['your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] mean the year that will bring ['our', 'us', 'our', 'us'] to the end of ['our', 'us', 'our', 'us'] imprisonment, or the year that sees ['our', 'us', 'our', 'us'] continue this strange voyage?” 
 
“Really, ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] do not know how to answer, ['master', 'master']. ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] are sure to see curious things, and for the last two months ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] have not had time for dullness. The last marvel is always the most astonishing; and, if ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] continue ['this progression', 'it'], ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] do not know how ['this progression', 'it'] will end. It is ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] opinion that ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] shall never again see the like. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] think then, with no offence to ['master', 'master'], that a happy year would be one in which ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] could see everything.” 
 
On 2nd January ['we', 'our', 'Our'] had made 11,340 miles, or 5,250 French leagues, since ['we', 'our', 'Our'] starting-point in the Japan Seas. Before ['the ship’s', 'Cook’s vessel', 'The boat in which Cook', 'it'] head stretched the dangerous shores of the coral sea, on the north-east coast of Australia. ['we', 'our', 'Our'] boat lay along some miles from the redoubtable bank on which ['the ship’s', 'Cook’s vessel', 'The boat in which['Cook’s', 'Cook'], 'it'] was lost, 10th June, 1770. ['the ship’s', 'Cook’s vessel', 'The boat in which Cook', '['Cook’s', 'Cook'] was struck on a rock, and, if ['the ship’s', 'Cook’s vessel', 'The boat in which Cook', 'it'] did not sink, it was owing to a piece of coral that was broken by the shock, and fixed itself in the broken keel. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] had wished to visit the reef, 360 leagues long, against which the sea, always rough, broke with great violence, with a noise like thunder. But just then the inclined planes drew the _Nautilus_ down to a great depth, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] could see nothing of the high coral walls. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] had to content ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] with the different specimens of fish brought up by the nets. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] remarked, among others, some germons, a species of mackerel as large as a tunny, with bluish sides, and striped with transverse bands, that disappear with the animal’s life. 
 
These fish followed ['us', 'us', 'We'] in shoals, and furnished ['us', 'us', 'We'] with very delicate food. ['us', 'us', 'We'] took also a large number of gilt-heads, about one and a half inches long, tasting like dorys; and ['flying pyrapeds like submarine swallows, which, in dark nights, light alternately the air and water with their phosp['flying pyrapeds like submarine swallows, which, in dark nights, light alternately the air and water with their phosphorescent light', 'their']cent light', 'their']. Among the molluscs and zoophytes, ['I', 'I'] found in the meshes of the net several species of alcyonarians, echini, hammers, spurs, dials, cerites, and hyalleae. The flora was represented by ['beautiful floating seaweeds, laminariae, and macrocystes, impregnated with the mucilage that transudes through their pores['beautiful floating seaweeds, laminariae, and macrocystes, impregnated with the mucilage that transudes through their pores', 'their']heir']; and among which ['I', 'I'] gathered an admirable Nemastoma Geliniarois, that was classed among the natural curiosities of the museum. 
 
Two days after crossing the coral sea, 4th January, we ['sighted', 'this occasion'] the Papuan coasts. On ['sighted', 'this occasion'], ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'His'] informed me that ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'His'] intention was to get into the Indian Ocean by the Strait of Torres. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'His'] communication ended there. 
 
['The Torres Straits', 'they', 'its', 'them'] are nearly thirty-four leagues wide; but ['The Torres Straits', 'they', 'its', 'them'] are obstructed by an innumerable quantity of islands, islets, breakers, and rocks, that make ['The Torres Straits', 'they', 'its', 'them'] navigation almost impracticable; so that Captain Nemo took all needful precautions to cross ['The Torres Straits', 'they', 'its', 'them']. ['The _Nautilus_', 'Her'], floating betwixt wind and water, went at a moderate pace. ['The _Nautilus_', 'Her'] screw, like a cetacean’s tail, beat the waves slowly. 
 
Profiting by this, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'['I and my two c['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I']panions', 'us'] went up on to the deserted platform. Before ['I and my two companions', 'us'] was the steersman’s cage, and ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] expected that Captain Nemo was there directing the course of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_']. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] had before ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] ['the excellent charts of the Straits of Torres', 'them'], and ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] consulted ['the excellent charts of the Straits of Torres', 'them'] attentively. Round ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] the sea dashed furiously. The course of the waves, that went from south-east to north-west at the rate of two and a half miles, broke on ['the coral that showed itself here ['the coral that showed itself here and there', 'itself']ere', 'itself']. 
 
“This is a bad sea!” remarked Ned Land. 
 
“Detestable indeed, and one that does not suit a boat like the _Nautilus_.” 
 
“['The Captain', 'his'] must be very sure of ['The Captain', 'his'] route, for I see there ['pieces of coral that would do for its keel if it only tou['pieces of coral that would do for its keel if it only touched them slightly', 'its', 'it', 'them']d them sl['pieces of coral that would do for its keel if it only touched them slightly', 'its', 'it', 'them']htly', 'its', ['pieces of coral that would do for its keel if it only touched them slightly', 'its', 'it', 'them'], 'them'].” 
 
Indeed the situation was dangerous, but ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'It', 'it', 'it'] seemed to slide like magic off these rocks. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'It', 'it', 'it'] did not follow ['the routes of the Astrolabe and the Zelee', 'they'] exactly, for ['the routes of the Astrolabe and the Zelee', 'they'] proved fatal to ['Dumont d’Urville', 'it']. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'It', 'it', 'it'] bore more northwards, coasted the Islands of Murray, and came back to the south-west towards Cumberland Passage. I thought ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'It', 'it', 'it'] was going to pass ['Dumont d’Urville', 'it'] by, when, going back to north-west, ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'It', 'it', 'it'] went through a large quantity of islands and islets little known, towards the Island Sound and Canal Mauvais. 
 
I wondered if ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he'], foolishly imprudent, would steer ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he'] vessel into that pass where Dumont d’Urville’s two corvettes touched; when, swerving again, and cutting straight through to the west, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he'] steered for the Island of Gilboa. 
 
It was then three in the afternoon. The tide began to recede, being quite full. ['The _Nautilus_', 'He', 'The _Nautilus_'] approached ['the island, that I still saw, wi['I', 'me']h its remarkable ['the island, that I still saw, with its remarkable border of screw-pines', 'its', 'it']der of screw-pines', 'its', 'it']. ['The _Nautilus_', 'He', 'The _Nautilus_'] stood off ['the island, that I still saw, with its remarkable border of screw-pines', 'its', 'it'] at about two miles distant. Suddenly a shock overthrew ['I', 'me']. ['The _Nautilus_', 'He', 'The _Nautilus_'] just touched a rock, and stayed immovable, laying lightly to port side. 
 
When ['I', 'I'] rose, ['I', 'I'] perceived ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] and ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] lieutenant on the platform. ['They', 'their'] were examining the situation of the vessel, and exchanging words in ['They', 'their'] incomprehensible dialect. 
 
['She', 'the vessel', 'her', 'she', 'she'] was situated thus: Two miles, on the starboard side, appeared Gilboa, stretching from north to west like an immense arm. Towards the south and east ['some coral', 'itself'] showed ['some coral', 'itself'], left by the ebb. We had run aground, and in one of those seas where the tides are middling—a sorry matter for the floating of the _Nautilus_. However, ['She', 'the vessel', 'her', 'she', 'she'] had not suffered, for ['She', 'the vessel', 'her', 'she', 'she'] keel was solidly joined. But, if ['She', 'the vessel', 'her', 'she', 'she'] could neither glide off nor move, ['She', 'the vessel', 'her', 'she', 'she'] ran the risk of being for ever fastened to these rocks, and then Captain Nemo’s submarine vessel would be done for. 
 
['I', 'me'] was reflecting thus, when ['the Captain, cool and calm, always master of himself', 'hi['the Captain, cool and calm, always master of himself', 'himself'], approached ['I', 'me']. 
 
“An accident?” I asked. 
 
“No; an incident.” 
 
“But an incident that will oblige you perhaps to become an inhabitant of this land from which you flee?” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'he'] looked at me curiously, and made a negative gesture, as much as to say that nothing would force ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'he'] to set foot on terra firma again. Then ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'he'] said: 
 
“Besides, ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'your'], ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] is not lost; ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] will carry ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'your'] yet into the midst of the marvels of the ocean. Our voyage is only begun, and I do not wish to be deprived so soon of the honour of ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'your'] company.” 
 
“However, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'you'],” ['I', 'I'] replied, without noticing the ironical turn of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'you'] phrase, “['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'] ran aground in open sea. Now the tides are not strong in the Pacific; and, if ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'you'] cannot lighten ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'], ['I', 'I'] do not see how ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'] will be reinflated.” 
 
“The tides are not strong in the Pacific: ['you', 'Professor'] are right there, ['you', 'Professor']; but in Torres Straits one finds still a difference of a yard and a half between the level of high and low seas. To-day is 4th January, and in five days the moon will be full. Now, ['I', 'me', 'I'] shall be very much astonished if ['that satellite', 'her'] does not raise these masses of water sufficiently, and render ['I', 'me', 'I'] a service that ['I', 'me', 'I'] should be indebted to ['that satellite', 'her'] for.” 
 
Having said this, ['Captain Nemo', 'his'], followed by ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] lieutenant, redescended to the interior of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'it', 'it']. As to ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'it', 'it'], ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'it', 'it'] moved not, and was immovable, as if ['the coralline polypi', 'their'] had already walled ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'it', 'it'] up with ['the coralline polypi', 'their'] in destructible cement. 
 
“Well, ['sir', 'Ned Land, who came up to me after the departure of the Captain']?” said ['sir', 'Ned Land, who came up to me after the departure of the Captain']. 
 
“Well, friend Ned, we will wait patiently for the tide on the 9th instant; for it appears that the moon will have the goodness to put it off again.” 
 
“Really?” 
 
“Really.” 
 
“And this Captain is not going to cast anchor at all since the tide will suffice?” said Conseil, simply. 
 
['The Canadian', 'his'] looked at Conseil, then shrugged ['The Canadian', 'his'] shoulders. 
 
“['Sir', 'you', 'you'], ['Sir', 'you', 'you'] may believe ['me', 'I', 'I'] when ['me', 'I', 'I'] tell ['Sir', 'you', 'you'] that ['this piece of iron', 'it', 'its'] will navigate neither on nor under the sea again; ['this piece of iron', 'it', 'its'] is only fit to be sold for ['this piece of iron', 'it', 'its'] weight. ['me', 'I', 'I'] think, therefore, that the time has come to part company with Captain Nemo.” 
 
“['Friend Ned', 'you'], ['I', 'I'] do not despair of ['this stout _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself'], as ['Friend Ned', 'you'] do; and in four days ['we', 'we'] shall know what to hold to on the Pacific tides. Besides, flight might be possible if ['we', 'we'] were in sight of the English or Provencal coast; but on the Papuan shores, it is another thing; and it will be time enough to come to that extremity if ['this stout _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself'] does not recover ['this stout _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself'] again, which ['I', 'I'] look upon as a grave event.” 
 
“But do they know, at least, how to act circumspectly? There is ['an island', 'that island']; on ['an island', 'that island'] there are ['trees', 'those trees']; under ['trees', 'those trees'], terrestrial animals, bearers of cutlets and roast beef, to which I would willingly give a trial.” 
 
“In this, ['friend Ned', 'him'] is right,” said ['Conseil', 'I'], “and ['Conseil', 'I'] agree with ['friend Ned', 'him']. Could not ['master', 'his'] obtain permission from ['master', 'his'] friend Captain Nemo to put ['us', 'our'] on land, if only so as not to lose the habit of treading on the solid parts of ['us', 'our'] planet?” 
 
“I can ask ['him', 'he'], but ['him', 'he'] will refuse.” 
 
“Will master risk it?” asked Conseil, “and we shall know how to rely upon the Captain’s amiability.” 
 
To ['my', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'I'] great surprise, ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] gave ['my', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'I'] ['the permission I asked ['my', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'I']or', 'it'], and ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] gave ['the permission I asked for', 'it'] very agreeably, without even exacting from ['my', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'I'] a promise to return to ['the vessel', 'the _Nautilus_']; but ['flight across New Guinea', 'it'] might be very perilous, and ['my', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'I'] should not have counselled Ned Land to attempt ['flight across New Guinea', 'it']. Better to be a prisoner on board ['the vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'] than to fall into the hands of the natives. 
 
At eight o’clock, armed with guns and hatchets, ['we', 'we', 'them'] got off ['the _Nautilus_', 'The boat']. The sea was pretty calm; a slight breeze blew on land. Conseil and I rowing, ['we', 'we', 'them'] sped along quickly, and Ned steered in the straight passage that the breakers left between ['we', 'we', 'them']. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The boat'] was well handled, and moved rapidly. 
 
['Ned Land', 'his', 'He'] could not restrain ['Ned Land', 'his', 'He'] joy. ['Ned Land', 'his', 'He'] was like a prisoner that had escaped from ['prison', 'it'], and knew not that it was necessary to re-enter ['prison', 'it']. 
 
“Meat! We are going to eat some meat; and what meat!” he replied. “Real game! no, bread, indeed.” 
 
“I do not say that ['fish', 'it'] is not good; we must not abuse ['fish', 'it']; but a piece of fresh venison, grilled on live coals, will agreeably vary our ordinary course.” 
 
“['Glutton', 'he']!” said ['Conseil', 'my'], “['Glutton', 'he'] makes ['Conseil', 'my'] mouth water.” 
 
“It remains to be seen,” I said, “if these forests are full of ['game', 'the game'], and if ['game', 'the game'] is not such as will hunt ['the hunter himself', 'hi['the hunter himself', 'himself'].” 
 
“Well said, M. Aronnax,” replied ['the Canadian, whose teeth seemed sharpened like the edge of a hatchet', 'I']; “but ['the Canadian, whose teeth seemed sharpened like the edge of a hatchet', 'I'] will eat tiger—loin of tiger—if there is no other quadruped on this island.” 
 
“Friend Ned is uneasy about it,” said Conseil. 
 
“Whatever it may be,” continued ['Ned Land', 'my'], “every animal with four paws without feathers, or with two paws without feathers, will be saluted by ['Ned Land', 'my'] first shot.” 
 
“Very well! Master Land’s imprudences are beginning.” 
 
“Never fear, ['M. Aronnax', 'the Canadian', 'I', 'you', 'my'],” replied ['M. Aronnax', 'the Canadian', 'I', 'you', 'my']; “['M. Aronnax', 'the Canadian', 'I', 'you', 'my'] do not want twenty-five minutes to offer ['M. Aronnax', 'the Canadian', 'I', 'you', 'my'] a dish, of ['M. Aronnax', 'the Canadian', 'I', 'you', 'my'] sort.” 
 
At half-past eight the _Nautilus_ boat ran softly aground on a heavy sand, after having happily passed the coral reef that surrounds the Island of Gilboa. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XX A FEW DAYS ON LAND 
 
I was much impressed on touching land. ['Ned Land', 'his'] tried ['the soil', 'it'] with ['Ned Land', 'his'] feet, as if to take possession of ['the soil', 'it']. However, it was only two months before that we had become, according to Captain Nemo, “passengers on board ['the _Nautilus', 'its']_,” but, in reality, prisoners of ['the _Nautilus', 'its'] commander. 
 
In a few minutes we were within musket-shot of the coast. The whole horizon was hidden behind a beautiful curtain of forests. ['Enormous trees, the trunks of which attained a height of 200 feet', 'They', 'their'], were tied to each other by garlands of bindweed, real natural hammocks, which a light breeze rocked. ['Enormous trees, the trunks of which attained a height of 200 feet', 'They', 'their'] were mimosas, figs, hibisci, and palm trees, mingled together in profusion; and under the shelter of ['Enormous trees, the trunks of which attained a height of 200 feet', 'They', 'their'] verdant vault grew orchids, leguminous plants, and ferns. 
 
But, without noticing all these beautiful specimens of Papuan flora, ['the Canadian', 'He'] abandoned the agreeable for the useful. ['the Canadian', 'He'] discovered a coco-tree, beat down ['some of the fruit', 'them'], broke ['some of the fruit', 'them'], and we drunk the milk and ate the nut with a satisfaction that protested against the ordinary food on the _Nautilus_. 
 
“Excellent!” said Ned Land. 
 
“Exquisite!” replied Conseil. 
 
“And ['I', 'the Canadian'] do not think,” said ['I', 'the Canadian'], “that he would object to our introducing a cargo of coco-nuts on board.” 
 
“I do not think ['he', 'he'] would, but ['he', 'he'] would not taste them.” 
 
“So much the worse for him,” said Conseil. 
 
“And so much the better for ['us', 'us'],” replied Ned Land. “There will be more for ['us', 'us'].” 
 
“One word only, Master Land,” I said to the harpooner, who was beginning to ravage another coco-nut tree. “['Coco-nuts', 'them'] are good things, but before filling the canoe with ['Coco-nuts', 'them'] it would be wise to reconnoitre and see if the island does not produce some substance not less useful. Fresh vegetables would be welcome on board the _Nautilus_.” 
 
“Master is right,” replied ['Conseil', 'I', 'I']; “and ['Conseil', 'I', 'I'] propose to reserve three places in our vessel, one for fruits, the other for vegetables, and the third for the venison, of which ['Conseil', 'I', 'I'] have not yet seen the smallest specimen.” 
 
“Conseil, we must not despair,” said the Canadian. 
 
“Let ['us', 'we'] continue,” I returned, “and lie in wait. Although ['the island', 'it'] seems uninhabited, ['the island', 'it'] might still contain some individuals that would be less hard than ['us', 'we'] on the nature of game.” 
 
“Ho! ho!” said ['Ned Land', 'his'], moving ['Ned Land', 'his'] jaws significantly. 
 
“Well, Ned!” said Conseil. 
 
“['My', 'the Canadian', 'I'] word!” returned ['My', 'the Canadian', 'I'], “['My', 'the Canadian', 'I'] begin to understand the charms of anthropophagy.” 
 
“Ned! Ned! what are ['you', 'I', 'you', 'I', 'your', 'I', 'myself'] saying? You, a man-eater? ['you', 'I', 'you', 'I', 'your', 'I', 'myself'] should not feel safe with ['you', 'I', 'you', 'I', 'your', 'I', 'myself'], especially as ['you', 'I', 'you', 'I', 'your', 'I', 'myself'] share ['you', 'I', 'you', 'I', 'your', 'I', 'myself'] cabin. ['you', 'I', 'you', 'I', 'your', 'I', 'myself'] might perhaps wake one day to find ['you', 'I', 'you', 'I', 'your', 'I', 'myself'] half devoured.” 
 
“['Friend Conseil', 'you', 'you'], I like ['Friend Conseil', 'you', 'you'] much, but not enough to eat ['Friend Conseil', 'you', 'you'] unnecessarily.” 
 
“['I', 'you', 'Conseil'] would not trust ['I', 'you', 'Conseil'],” replied ['I', 'you', 'Conseil']. “But enough. We must absolutely bring down some game to satisfy ['this cannibal', 'him'], or else one of these fine mornings, ['master', 'his'] will find only pieces of ['master', 'his'] servant to serve ['this cannibal', 'him'].” 
 
While ['we', 'we', 'we'] were talking thus, ['we', 'we', 'we'] were penetrating the sombre arches of ['the forest', 'it'], and for two hours ['we', 'we', 'we'] surveyed ['the forest', 'it'] in all directions. 
 
Chance rewarded ['our', 'us', 'we'] search for eatable vegetables, and one of the most useful products of the tropical zones furnished ['our', 'us', 'we'] with precious food that ['our', 'us', 'we'] missed on board. ['I', 'I'] would speak of the bread-fruit tree, very abundant in the island of Gilboa; and ['I', 'I'] remarked chiefly the variety destitute of seeds, which bears in Malaya the name of “rima.” 
 
['Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'himself'] knew ['these fruits', 'them'] well. ['Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'himself'] had already eaten many during ['Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'himself'] numerous voyages, and ['Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'himself'] knew how to prepare the eatable substance. Moreover, the sight of ['these fruits', 'them'] excited ['Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'himself'], and ['Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'himself'] could contain ['Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'himself'] no longer. 
 
“Master,” ['he', 'I', 'I'] said, “['he', 'I', 'I'] shall die if ['he', 'I', 'I'] do not taste a little of this bread-fruit pie.” 
 
“Taste ['it', 'it'], ['friend Ned', 'you']—taste ['it', 'it'] as ['friend Ned', 'you'] want. We are here to make ['experiments', 'them']—make ['experiments', 'them'].” 
 
“It won’t take long,” said the Canadian. 
 
And, provided with a lentil, he lighted a fire of dead wood that crackled joyously. During this time, Conseil and I chose the best fruits of the bread-fruit. ['Some', 'their'] had not then attained a sufficient degree of maturity; and ['Some', 'their'] thick skin covered a white but rather fibrous pulp. Others, the greater number yellow and gelatinous, waited only to be picked. 
 
These fruits enclosed no kernel. Conseil brought ['a dozen', 'them', 'them'] to Ned Land, who placed ['a dozen', 'them', 'them'] on a coal fire, after having cut ['a dozen', 'them', 'them'] in thick slices, and while doing this repeating: 
 
“['You', 'master', 'he', 'You', 'master'] will see, ['You', 'master', 'he', 'You', 'master'], how good ['this bread', 'it', 'It'] is. More so when one has been deprived of ['this bread', 'it', 'It'] so long. ['this bread', 'it', 'It'] is not even bread,” added ['You', 'master', 'he', 'You', 'master'], “but a delicate pastry. ['You', 'master', 'he', 'You', 'master'] have eaten none, ['You', 'master', 'he', 'You', 'master']?” 
 
“No, Ned.” 
 
“Very well, prepare ['yourself', 'you'] for a juicy thing. If ['yourself', 'you'] do not come for more, I am no longer the king of harpooners.” 
 
After some minutes, the part of the fruits that was exposed to the fire was completely roasted. The interior looked like a white pasty, a sort of soft crumb, the flavour of which was like that of an artichoke. 
 
It must be confessed ['this bread', 'it'] was excellent, and I ate of ['this bread', 'it'] with great relish. 
 
“What time is it now?” asked the Canadian. 
 
“Two o’clock at least,” replied Conseil. 
 
“How time flies on firm ground!” sighed Ned Land. 
 
“Let us be off,” replied Conseil. 
 
['We', 'our', 'we'] returned through the forest, and completed ['We', 'our', 'we'] collection by a raid upon the cabbage-palms, that ['We', 'our', 'we'] gathered from the tops of the trees, little beans that I recognised as the “abrou” of the Malays, and yams of a superior quality. 
 
['We', 'we', 'us', 'we'] were loaded when ['We', 'we', 'us', 'we'] reached the boat. But ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he'] did not find ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he'] provisions sufficient. Fate, however, favoured ['We', 'we', 'us', 'we']. Just as ['We', 'we', 'us', 'we'] were pushing off, ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he'] perceived several trees, from twenty-five to thirty feet high, a species of palm-tree. 
 
At last, at five o’clock in the evening, loaded with ['our', 'we', 'we', 'ou['our riches', 'The provisions'], ['our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] quitted the shore, and half an hour after ['our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] hailed ['the _Nautilus_', 'The enormous iron-plated cylinder']. No one appeared on ['our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] arrival. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The enormous iron-plated cylinder'] seemed deserted. ['our riches', 'The provisions'] embarked, ['I', 'my'] descended to ['I', 'my'] chamber, and after supper slept soundly. 
 
The next day, 6th January, nothing new on board. Not a sound inside, not a sign of life. ['The boat', 'it'] rested along the edge, in the same place in which ['we', 'We'] had left ['The boat', 'it']. ['we', 'We'] resolved to return to the island. Ned Land hoped to be more fortunate than on the day before with regard to the hunt, and wished to visit another part of the forest. 
 
At dawn we set off. The boat, carried on by the waves that flowed to shore, reached the island in a few minutes. 
 
['We', 'we', 'us'] landed, and, thinking that it was better to give in to the Canadian, ['We', 'we', 'us'] followed ['Ned Land, whose long limbs threatened to distance us', 'He', 'he['We', 'we', 'us']. ['Ned Land, whose long limbs threatened to distance us', 'He', 'he'] wound up the coast towards the west: then, fording some torrents, ['Ned Land, whose long limbs threatened to distance us', 'He', 'he'] gained the high plain that was bordered with admirable forests. ['Some kingfishers', 'they', 'themselves', 'Their', 'these birds'] were rambling along the water-courses, but ['Some kingfishers', 'they', 'themselves', 'Their', 'these birds'] would not let ['Some kingfishers', 'they', 'themselves', 'Their', 'these birds'] be approached. ['Some kingfishers', 'they', 'themselves', 'Their', 'these birds'] circumspection proved to ['me', 'I'] that ['Some kingfishers', 'they', 'themselves', 'Their', 'these birds'] knew what to expect from bipeds of our species, and ['me', 'I'] concluded that, if ['the island', 'it'] was not inhabited, at least human beings occasionally frequented ['the island', 'it']. 
 
After crossing a rather large prairie, we arrived at the skirts of a little wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large number of birds. 
 
“There are only birds,” said Conseil. 
 
“But they are eatable,” replied the harpooner. 
 
“['I', 'I'] do not agree with ['you', 'friend Ned'], ['you', 'friend Ned'], for ['I', 'I'] see only parrots there.” 
 
“Friend Conseil,” said Ned, gravely, “the parrot is like pheasant to those who have nothing else.” 
 
“And,” I added, “this bird, suitably prepared, is worth knife and fork.” 
 
Indeed, under the thick foliage of this wood, ['a world of parrots', 'they'] were flying from branch to branch, only needing a careful education to speak the human language. For the moment, ['a world of parrots', 'they'] were chattering with parrots of all colours, and grave cockatoos, who seemed to meditate upon some philosophical problem, whilst brilliant red lories passed like a piece of bunting carried away by the breeze, papuans, with the finest azure colours, and in all a variety of winged things most charming to behold, but few eatable. 
 
However, ['a bird peculiar to these lands, and which has never passed the limits of the Arrow and Papuan islands', 'it'], was wanting in this collection. But fortune reserved ['a bird peculiar to these lands, and which has never passed the limits of the Arrow and Papuan islands', 'it'] for me before long. 
 
After passing through a moderately thick copse, we found a plain obstructed with bushes. ['I', 'I'] saw then ['those magnificent birds, the disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the wind', 'them['those magnificent birds, the disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the wind', 'them', 'Their', 'their', 'them']Their', 'their', 'them']. ['those magnificent birds, the disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the wind', 'them', 'Their', 'their', 'them'] undulating flight, graceful aerial curves, and the shading of ['those magnificent birds, the disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the wind', 'them', 'Their', 'their', 'them'] colours, attracted and charmed one’s looks. ['I', 'I'] had no trouble in recognising ['those magnificent birds, the disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the wind', 'them', 'Their', 'their', 'them']. 
 
“Birds of paradise!” I exclaimed. 
 
['The Malays, who carry on a great trade in these birds with the Chine['these birds', 'them', 'the birds of paradise', 'them', 'their', 'the birds', 'them', 'them'], 'they', 'They'], have several means that ['we', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'our'] could not employ for taking ['these birds', 'them', 'the birds of paradise', 'them', 'their', 'the birds', 'them', 'them']. Sometimes ['The Malays, who carry on a great trade in these birds with the Chinese', 'they', 'they', 'They'] put snares on the top of high trees that ['these birds', 'them', 'the birds of paradise', 'them', 'their', 'the birds', 'them', 'them'] prefer to frequent. Sometimes ['The Malays, who carry on a great trade in these birds with the Chinese', 'they', 'they', 'They'] catch ['these birds', 'them', 'the birds of paradise', 'them', 'their', 'the birds', 'them', 'them'] with a viscous birdlime that paralyses ['these birds', 'them', 'the birds of paradise', 'them', 'their', 'the birds', 'them', 'them'] movements. ['The Malays, who carry on a great trade in these birds with the Chinese', 'they', 'they', 'They'] even go so far as to poison the fountains that ['these birds', 'them', 'the birds of paradise', 'them', 'their', 'the birds', 'them', 'them'] generally drink from. But ['we', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'our'] were obliged to fire at ['these birds', 'them', 'the birds of paradise', 'them', 'their', 'the birds', 'them', 'them'] during flight, which gave ['we', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'our'] few chances to bring ['these birds', 'them', 'the birds of paradise', 'them', 'their', 'the birds', 'them', 'them'] down; and, indeed, ['we', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'our'] vainly exhausted one half ['we', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'our'] ammunition. 
 
About eleven o’clock in the morning, the first range of mountains that form the centre of the island was traversed, and ['we', 'us'] had killed nothing. Hunger drove ['we', 'us'] on. ['The hunters', 'they'] had relied on the products of the chase, and ['The hunters', 'they'] were wrong. ['Happily Conseil', 'his', 'He'], to ['Happily Conseil', 'his', 'He'] great surprise, made a double shot and secured breakfast. ['Happily Conseil', 'his', 'He'] brought down a white pigeon and a wood-pigeon, which, cleverly plucked and suspended from a skewer, was roasted before a red fire of dead wood. While these interesting birds were cooking, Ned prepared the fruit of the bread-tree. Then ['the wood-pigeons', 'they', 'their', 'their'] were devoured to the bones, and declared excellent. The nutmeg, with which ['the wood-pigeons', 'they', 'their', 'their'] are in the habit of stuffing ['the wood-pigeons', 'they', 'their', 'their'] crops, flavours ['the wood-pigeons', 'they', 'their', 'th['their flesh', 'it'] and renders ['their flesh', 'it'] delicious eating. 
 
“Now, ['Ned', 'you'], what do ['Ned', 'you'] miss now?” 
 
“Some four-footed game, M. Aronnax. All these pigeons are only side-dishes and trifles; and until ['I', 'I'] have killed an animal with cutlets ['I', 'I'] shall not be content.” 
 
“Nor ['I', 'I'], Ned, if ['I', 'I'] do not catch a bird of paradise.” 
 
“Let ['us', 'us', 'We', 'we'] continue hunting,” replied ['Conseil', 'I']. “Let ['us', 'us', 'We', 'we'] go towards the sea. ['us', 'us', 'We', 'we'] have arrived at the first declivities of the mountains, and ['Conseil', 'I'] think ['us', 'us', 'We', 'we'] had better regain the region of forests.” 
 
That was sensible advice, and was followed out. After walking for one hour ['we', 'us', 'our'] had attained a forest of sago-trees. ['Some inoffensive serpents', 'The birds of paradise'] glided away from ['we', 'us', 'our']. ['Some inoffensive serpents', 'The birds of paradise'] fled at ['we', 'us', 'our'] approach, and truly ['I', 'me'] despaired of getting near one when Conseil, who was walking in front, suddenly bent down, uttered a triumphal cry, and came back to ['I', 'me'] bringing a magnificent specimen. 
 
“Ah! bravo, Conseil!” 
 
“Master is very good.” 
 
“No, ['my boy', 'you', 'your']; ['my boy', 'you', 'your'] have made an excellent stroke. Take ['one of these living birds', 'it'], and carry ['one of these living birds', 'it'] in ['my boy', 'you', 'your'] hand.” 
 
“If ['master', 'he'] will examine it, ['master', 'he'] will see that I have not deserved great merit.” 
 
“Why, Conseil?” 
 
“Because this bird is as drunk as a quail.” 
 
“Drunk!” 
 
“Yes, sir; drunk with the nutmegs that ['it', 'it'] devoured under the nutmeg-tree, under which I found ['it', 'it']. See, friend Ned, see the monstrous effects of intemperance!” 
 
“By Jove!” exclaimed ['the Canadian', 'I', 'me'], “because ['the Canadian', 'I', 'me'] have drunk gin for two months, you must needs reproach ['the Canadian', 'I', 'me']!” 
 
However, I examined ['the curious bird', 'The bird', 'It', 'it']. Conseil was right. ['the curious bird', 'The bird', 'It', 'it'], drunk with the juice, was quite powerless. ['the curious bird', 'The bird', 'It', 'it'] could not fly; ['the curious bird', 'The bird', 'It', 'it'] could hardly walk. 
 
['This bird', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'this marvellous bird, that the natives have poetically named the “bird of the sun'] belonged to the most beautiful of the eight species that are found in Papua and in the neighbouring islands. ['This bird', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'this marvellous bird, that the natives have poetically named the “bird of the sun'] was the “large emerald bird, the most rare kind.” ['This bird', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'this marvellous bird, that the natives have poetically named the “bird of the sun'] measured three feet in length. ['This bird', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'this marvellous bird, that the natives have poetically named the “bird of the sun'] head was comparatively small, ['This bird', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'this marvellous bird, that the natives have poetically named the “bird of the sun'] eyes placed near the opening of the beak, and also small. But the shades of colour were beautiful, having a yellow beak, brown feet and claws, nut-coloured wings with purple tips, pale yellow at the back of the neck and head, and emerald colour at the throat, chestnut on the breast and belly. ['Two horned, downy nets', 'they'] rose from below the tail, that prolonged the long light feathers of admirable fineness, and ['Two horned, downy nets', 'they'] completed the whole of ['This bird', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'this marvellous bird, that the natives have poetically named the “bird of the sun'].” 
 
But if my wishes were satisfied by the possession of the bird of paradise, the Canadian’s were not yet. Happily, about two o’clock, ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'his', 'The Canadian', 'Ned'] brought down ['a magnificent hog', 'The animal', 'he', 'The hog', 'it']; from the brood of those the natives call “bari-outang.” ['a magnificent hog', 'The animal', 'he', 'The hog', 'it'] came in time for ['us', 'us'] to procure real quadruped meat, and ['a magnificent hog', 'The animal', 'he', 'The hog', 'it'] was well received. ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'his', 'The Canadian', 'Ned'] was very proud of ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'his', 'The Canadian', 'Ned'] shot. ['a magnificent hog', 'The animal', 'he', 'The hog', 'it'], hit by the electric ball, fell stone dead. ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'his', 'The Canadian', 'Ned'] skinned and cleaned ['a magnificent hog', 'The animal', 'he', 'The hog', 'it'] properly, after having taken half a dozen cutlets, destined to furnish ['us', 'us'] with a grilled repast in the evening. Then the hunt was resumed, which was still more marked by ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'his', 'The Canadian', 'Ned'] and Conseil’s exploits. 
 
Indeed, the two friends, beating the bushes, roused ['a herd of kangaroos that fled and bounded along on their elastic paws', 'their', 'these ['a herd of kangaroos that fled and bounded along on their elastic paws', 'their', 'these animals', 'their']ls', 'their']. But ['a herd of kangaroos that fled and bounded along on their elastic paws', 'their', 'these animals', 'their'] did not take to flight so rapidly but what the electric capsule could stop ['a herd of kangaroos that fled and bounded along on their elastic paws', 'their', 'these animals', 'their'] course. 
 
“Ah, Professor!” cried Ned Land, who was carried away by the delights of the chase, “what excellent game, and stewed, too! What a supply for the _Nautilus!_ Two! three! five down! And to think that we shall eat that flesh, and that the idiots on board shall not have a crumb!” 
 
I think that, in the excess of ['his', 'the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'himself'] joy, ['his', 'the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'himself'], if ['his', 'the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'himself'] had not talked so much, would have killed ['them all', 'all', 'these interesting marsupians', 'These animals', 'They', 'the['them all', 'all', 'these interesting marsupians', 'These animals', 'They', 'they']. But ['his', 'the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'himself'] contented ['his', 'the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'himself'] with a single dozen of ['them all', 'all', 'these interesting marsupians', 'These animals', 'They', 'they']. ['them all', 'all', 'these interesting marsupians', 'These animals', 'They', 'they'] were small. ['them all', 'all', 'these interesting marsupians', 'These animals', 'They', 'they'] were a species of those “kangaroo rabbitss” that live habitually in the hollows of trees, and whose speed is extreme; but ['them all', 'all', 'these interesting marsupians', 'These animals', 'They', 'they'] are moderately fat, and furnish, at least, estimable food. We were very satisfied with the results of the hunt. ['Happy Ned', 'he', 'he', 'his'] proposed to return to ['this enchanting island', 'it'] the next day, for ['Happy Ned', 'he', 'he', 'his'] wished to depopulate ['this enchanting island', 'it'] of all the eatable quadrupeds. But ['Happy Ned', 'he', 'he', 'his'] had reckoned without ['Happy Ned', 'he', 'he', 'his'] host. 
 
At six o’clock in the evening ['we', 'our'] had regained the shore; ['we', 'our'] boat was moored to the usual place. The _Nautilus_, like a long rock, emerged from the waves two miles from the beach. ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'He'], without waiting, occupied ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'He'] about the important dinner business. ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'He'] understood all about cooking well. The “bari-outang,” grilled on the coals, soon scented the air with a delicious odour. 
 
Indeed, the dinner was excellent. Two wood-pigeons completed this extraordinary menu. The sago pasty, the artocarpus bread, some mangoes, half a dozen pineapples, and the liquor fermented from some coco-nuts, overjoyed us. ['I', 'my'] even think that ['I', 'my'] worthy companions’ ideas had not all the plainness desirable. 
 
“Suppose we do not return to the _Nautilus_ this evening?” said Conseil. 
 
“Suppose we never return?” added Ned Land. 
 
Just then a stone fell at our feet and cut short the harpooner’s proposition. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXI CAPTAIN NEMO’S THUNDERBOLT 
 
We looked at the edge of the forest without rising, ['my hand'['my', 'my']'it'] stopping in the action of putting ['my hand', 'it'] to ['my', 'my'] mouth, ['Ned Land’s', 'its'] completing ['Ned Land’s', 'its'] office. 
 
“['Stones', 'they'] do not fall from the sky,” remarked Conseil, “or ['Stones', 'they'] would merit the name aerolites.” 
 
A second stone, carefully aimed, that made a savoury pigeon’s leg fall from ['Conseil’s', 'his'] hand, gave still more weight to ['Conseil’s', 'his'] observation. ['We all three', 'our'] arose, shouldered ['We all three', 'our'] guns, and were ready to reply to any attack. 
 
“Are they apes?” cried Ned Land. 
 
“Very nearly—they are savages.” 
 
“To the boat!” I said, hurrying to the sea. 
 
It was indeed necessary to beat a retreat, for about twenty natives armed with bows and slings appeared on the skirts of a copse that masked the horizon to the right, hardly a hundred steps from us. 
 
['Our', 'us', 'us'] boat was moored about sixty feet from ['Our', 'us', 'us']. The savages approached ['Our', 'us', 'us'], not running, but making hostile demonstrations. Stones and arrows fell thickly. 
 
['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he'] had not wished to leave ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he'] provisions; and, in spite of ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he'] imminent danger, ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he'] pig on one side and kangaroos on the other, ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'he'] went tolerably fast. In two minutes ['we', 'We'] were on the shore. To load ['the boat', 'it'] with provisions and arms, to push ['the boat', 'it'] out to sea, and ship the oars, was the work of an instant. ['we', 'We'] had not gone two cable-lengths, when ['a hundred savages', 'their', 'their'], howling and gesticulating, entered the water up to ['a hundred savages', 'their', 'their'] waists. I watched to see if ['a hundred savages', 'their', 'their'] apparition would attract some men from the _Nautilus_ on to the platform. But no. The enormous machine, lying off, was absolutely deserted. 
 
Twenty minutes later ['we', 'we'] were on board. The panels were open. After making the boat fast, ['we', 'we'] entered into the interior of the _Nautilus_. 
 
['I', 'I'] descended to the drawing-room, from whence ['I', 'I'] heard some chords. ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] was there, bending over ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] organ, and plunged in a musical ecstasy. 
 
“Captain!” 
 
He did not hear me. 
 
“['Captain', 'his']!” I said, touching ['Captain', 'his'] hand. 
 
['He', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'you'] shuddered, and, turning round, said, “Ah! it is ['He', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'you'], ['He', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'you']? Well, have ['He', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'you'] had a good hunt, have ['He', 'you', 'Professor', 'you', 'you'] botanised successfully?” 
 
“Yes Captain; but we have unfortunately brought a troop of bipeds, whose vicinity troubles me.” 
 
“What bipeds?” 
 
“Savages.” 
 
“Savages!” ['he', 'you', 'Professor', 'you'] echoed, ironically. “So ['he', 'you', 'Professor', 'you'] are astonished, ['he', 'you', 'Professor', 'you'], at having set foot on a strange land and finding ['savages', 'they', 'these whom you call savages']? Savages! where are there not any? Besides, are ['savages', 'they', 'these whom you call savages'] worse than others, ['savages', 'they', 'these whom yo['he', 'you', 'Professor', 'you']all savages']?” 
 
“But Captain——” 
 
“How many have you counted?” 
 
“A hundred at least.” 
 
“M. Aronnax,” replied ['Captain Nemo', 'his'], placing ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] fingers on the organ stops, “when all the natives of Papua are assembled on this shore, ['the _Nautilus_', 'their'] will have nothing to fear from ['the _Nautilus_', 'their'] attacks.” 
 
['The Captain’s', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain'] fingers were then running over the keys of the instrument, and ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My'] remarked that ['The Captain’s', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain'] touched only the black keys, which gave ['The Captain’s', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain'] melodies an essentially Scotch character. Soon ['The Captain’s', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain'] had forgotten ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My'] presence, and had plunged into a reverie that ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My'] did not disturb. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My'] went up again on to the platform: night had already fallen; for, in this low latitude, the sun sets rapidly and without twilight. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My'] could only see ['the island', 'it'] indistinctly; but the numerous fires, lighted on the beach, showed that ['the natives', 'the natives', 'them', 'them'] did not think of leaving ['the island', 'it']. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My'] was alone for several hours, sometimes thinking of ['the natives', 'the natives', 'them', 'them']—but without any dread of ['the natives', 'the natives', 'them', 'them'], for the imperturbable confidence of ['The Captain’s', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain'] was catching—sometimes forgetting ['the natives', 'the natives', 'them', 'them'] to admire the splendours of the night in the tropics. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My'] remembrances went to France in the train of those zodiacal stars that would shine in some hours’ time. The moon shone in the midst of the constellations of the zenith. 
 
The night slipped away without any mischance, the islanders frightened no doubt at the sight of ['a monster', 'the _Nautilus_'] aground in the bay. The panels were open, and would have offered an easy access to the interior of ['a monster', 'the _Nautilus_']. 
 
At six o’clock in the morning of the 8th January I went up on to the platform. The dawn was breaking. ['The island', 'itself'] soon showed ['The island', 'itself'] through the dissipating fogs, first the shore, then the summits. 
 
['The natives', 'them', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'their', 'these savages', 'them'] were there, more numerous than on the day before—five or six hundred perhaps—some of ['The natives', 'them', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'their', 'these savages', 'them'], profiting by the low water, had come on to the coral, at less than two cable-lengths from ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_']. ['I', 'I'] distinguished ['The natives', 'them', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'their', 'these savages', 'them'] easily; ['The natives', 'them', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'their', 'these savages', 'them'] were true Papuans, with athletic figures, men of good race, large high foreheads, large, but not broad and flat, and white teeth. ['The natives', 'them', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'their', 'these savages', 'them'] woolly hair, with a reddish tinge, showed off on ['The natives', 'them', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'their', 'these savages', 'them'] black shining bodies like those of the Nubians. From the lobes of ['The natives', 'them', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'their', 'these savages', 'them'] ears, cut and distended, hung chaplets of bones. Most of ['The natives', 'them', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'their', 'these savages', 'them'] were naked. Amongst ['The natives', 'them', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'their', 'these savages', 'them'], ['I', 'I'] remarked some women, dressed from the hips to knees in quite a crinoline of herbs, that sustained a vegetable waistband. ['Some chiefs', 'their', 'these chiefs'] had ornamented ['Some chiefs', 'their', 'these chiefs'] necks with a crescent and collars of glass beads, red and white; ['nearly all', 'their', 'they', 'their'] were armed with bows, arrows, and shields and carried on ['nearly all', 'their', 'they', 'their'] shoulders ['a sort of net containing those round stones which they cas['nearly all', 'their', 'they', 'their']om their sl['nearly all', 'their', 'they', 'their']with great skill', 'it']. ['One of these chiefs',['Some chiefs', 'their', 'these chiefs'], rather near to ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'], examined ['a sort of net containing those round stones which they cast from their slings with great skill', 'it'] attentively. ['One of these chiefs', 'He', 'he'] was, perhaps, a “mado” of high rank, for ['One of these chiefs', 'He', 'he'] was draped in a mat of banana-leaves, notched round the edges, and set off with brilliant colours. 
 
['I', 'I'] could easily have knocked down this native, who was within a short length; but ['I', 'I'] thought that it was better to wait for real hostile demonstrations. Between Europeans and savages, it is proper for the Europeans to parry sharply, not to attack. 
 
During low water ['the natives', 'them', 'their', 'they'] roamed about near the _Nautilus_, but were not troublesome; ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] heard ['the natives', 'them', 'their', 'they'] frequently repeat the word “Assai,” and by ['the natives', 'them', 'their', 'they'] gestures ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] understood that ['the natives', 'them', 'their', 'they'] ['invited', 'an invitation that I declined'] ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] to go on land, ['invited', 'an invitation that I ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I']eclined']. 
 
So that, on that day, the boat did not push off, to the great displeasure of ['Master Land, who could not complete his provi['Master Land, who could not complete his provisions', 'his']ns', 'his']. 
 
['This adroit Canadian', 'his', 'he'] employed ['This adroit Canadian', 'his', 'he'] time in preparing the viands and meat that ['This adroit Canadian', 'his', 'he'] had brought off the island. As for ['the savages', 'they', 'their', 'they'], ['the savages', 'they', 'their', 'they'] returned to ['the shore', 'the shore'] about eleven o’clock in the morning, as soon as the coral tops began to disappear under the rising tide; but ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw ['the savages', 'they', 'their', 'they'] numbers had increased considerably on ['the shore', 'the shore']. Probably ['the savages', 'they', 'their', 'they'] came from the neighbouring islands, or very likely from Papua. However, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] had not seen a single native canoe. Having nothing better to do, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] thought of dragging ['these beautiful limpid waters, under which I saw a profusion['I', 'I', 'I', 'I']of shells, zoophytes, and marine plants', 'these parts']. Moreover, it was the last day that ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] would pass in ['these beautiful limpid waters, under which I saw a profusion of shells, zoophytes, and marine plants', 'these parts'], if ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] float in open sea the next day, according to Captain Nemo’s promise. 
 
['I', 'me', 'I'] therefore called Conseil, who brought ['I', 'me', 'I'] ['a little light drag, very like those for the oyster fishery', 'The drag']. Now to work! For two hours ['we', 'We'] fished unceasingly, but without bringing up any rarities. ['a little light drag, very like those for the oyster fishery', 'The drag'] was filled with midas-ears, harps, melames, and particularly the most beautiful hammers ['I', 'me', 'I'] have ever seen. ['we', 'We'] also brought up some sea-slugs, pearl-oysters, and a dozen little turtles that were reserved for the pantry on board. 
 
But just when ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] expected it least, ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] put ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] hand on a wonder, ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] might say a natural deformity, very rarely met with. ['Conseil', 'his', 'he'] was just dragging, and ['Conseil', 'his', 'h['his net', 'the net'] came up filled with divers ordinary shells, when, all at once, ['Conseil', 'his', 'he'] saw ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] plunge ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] arm quickly into ['his net', 'the net'], to draw out a shell, and heard ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] utter a cry. 
 
“What is the matter, ['sir', 'he']?” ['sir', 'he'] asked in surprise. “Has master been bitten?” 
 
“No, ['my', 'I', 'my'] boy; but ['my', 'I', 'my'] would willingly have given a finger for ['my', 'I', 'my'] discovery.” 
 
“What discovery?” 
 
“['This shell', 'the object of my triumph'],” ['I', 'my'] said, holding up ['This shell', 'the object of my['I', 'my']riumph']. 
 
“It is simply an olive porphyry, genus olive, order of the pectinibranchidæ, class of gasteropods, sub-class mollusca.” 
 
“Yes, Conseil; but, instead of being rolled from right to left, this olive turns from left to right.” 
 
“Is it possible?” 
 
“Yes, my boy; it is a left shell.” 
 
['Shells', 'their', 'amateurs', 'their'] are all right-handed, with rare exceptions; and, when by chance ['Shells', 'their', 'amateurs', 'their'] spiral is left, ['Shells', 'their', 'amateurs', 'their'] are ready to pay ['Shells', 'their', 'amateurs', 'their'] weight in gold. 
 
['Conseil a['Conseil', 'Conseil’s', 'Conseil', 'his', 'him']'our'['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] were absorbed in the contemplation of ['Conseil and I', 'ou['our treasure', 'it'], and ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] was promising ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] to enrich the museum with ['our treasure', 'it'], when a stone unfortunately thrown by ['a native', 'a savage who was poising his sling at ten yards from him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'the savage'] struck against, and broke, the precious object in ['Conseil', 'Conseil’s', 'Conseil', 'his', 'him'] hand. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] uttered a cry of despair! ['Conseil', 'Conseil’s', 'Conseil', 'his', 'him'] took up ['Conseil', 'Conseil’s', 'Conseil', 'his', 'him'] gun, and aimed at ['a native', 'a savage who was poising his sling at ten yards from him', 'hi['a native', 'a savage who was poising his sling at ten yards from him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'the savage'] 'him', 'his', 'the savag['Conseil', 'Conseil’s', 'Conseil', 'his', 'him']. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] would have stopped ['a native', 'a savage who was poising his sling at ten yards from him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'the savage'], but ['a native', 'a savage who was poising his sling at ten yards from him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'the savage'] blow took effect and broke the bracelet of amulets which encircled the arm of ['a native', 'a savage who was poising his sling at ten yards from him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'the savage']. 
 
[Illustration] ['Conseil', 'his'] seized ['Conseil', 'his'] gun 
 
“Conseil!” cried I. “Conseil!” 
 
“Well, ['sir', 'you']! do ['sir', 'you'] not see that the cannibal has commenced the attack?” 
 
“A shell is not worth the life of a man,” said I. 
 
“Ah! ['the scoundrel', 'he']!” cried ['Conseil', 'I', 'my']; “['Conseil', 'I', 'my'] would rather ['the scoundrel', 'he'] had broken ['Conseil', 'I', 'my'] shoulder!” 
 
['Conseil', 'his'] was in earnest, but ['I', 'I'] was not of ['Conseil', 'his'] opinion. However, the situation had changed some minutes before, and ['we', 'Our'] had not perceived. ['A score of canoes', 'These canoes, scooped out of the trunk of a tree, long, narrow, well adapted for speed', 'They', 'their'] surrounded the _Nautilus_. ['A score of canoes', 'These canoes, scooped out of the trunk of a tree, long, narrow, well adapted for speed', 'They', 'their'], were balanced by means of a long bamboo pole, which floated on the water. ['A score of canoes', 'These canoes, scooped out of the trunk of a tree, long, narrow, well adapted for speed', 'They', 'their'] were managed by skilful, half-naked paddlers, and ['I', 'I'] watched ['A score of canoes', 'These canoes, scooped out of the trunk of a tree, long, narrow, well adapted for speed', 'They', 'their'] advance with some uneasiness. It was evident that ['these Papuans', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves'] had already had dealings with ['the Europeans', 'their'] and knew ['the Europeans', 'their'] ships. But ['this long iron cylinder anchored in the bay, without masts or chimneys', 'it', 'it', 'it'], what could ['these Papuans', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves'] think of ['this long iron cylinder anchored in the bay, without masts or chimneys', 'it', 'it', 'it']? Nothing good, for at first ['these Papuans', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves'] kept at a respectful distance. However, seeing ['this long iron cylinder anchored in the bay, without masts or chimneys', 'it', 'it', 'it'] motionless, by degrees ['these Papuans', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves'] took courage, and sought to ['familiarise', 'this familiarity'] ['these Papuans', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves'] with ['this long iron cylinder anchored in the bay, without masts or chimneys', 'it', 'it', 'it']. Now ['familiarise', 'this familiarity'] was precisely what it was necessary to avoid. ['we', 'Our'] arms, which were noiseless, could only produce a moderate effect on the savages, who have little respect for aught but blustering things. The thunderbolt without the reverberations of thunder would frighten man but little, though the danger lies in the lightning, not in the noise. 
 
At this moment the canoes approached ['the _Nautilus_', 'her'], and a shower of arrows alighted on ['the _Nautilus_', 'her']. 
 
['I', 'I'] went down to the saloon, but found no one there. ['I', 'I'] ventured to knock at the door that opened into the Captain’s room. “Come in,” was the answer. 
 
I entered, and found Captain Nemo deep in algebraical calculations of _x_ and other quantities. 
 
“['I', 'you', 'I'] am disturbing ['I', 'you', 'I'],” said ['I', 'you', 'I'], for courtesy’s sake. 
 
“That is true, ['M. Aronnax', 'you'],” replied ['the Captain', 'I', 'me']; “but ['the Captain', 'I', 'me'] think ['M. Aronnax', 'you'] have serious reasons for wishing to see ['the Captain', 'I', 'me']?” 
 
“Very grave ones; ['the natives', 'their'] are surrounding ['us', 'we'] in ['the natives', 'their'] canoes, and in a few minutes ['us', 'we'] shall certainly be attacked by many hundreds of savages.” 
 
“Ah!” said Captain Nemo quietly, “['they', 'their'] are come with ['they', 'their'] canoes?” 
 
“Yes, sir.” 
 
“Well, sir, we must close the hatches.” 
 
“Exactly, and I came to say to you——” 
 
“Nothing can be more simple,” said ['Captain Nemo', 'he']. And, pressing an electric button, ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] transmitted an order to the ship’s crew. 
 
“It is all done, ['sir', 'You'],” said ['he', 'I'], after some moments. “The pinnace is ready, and the hatches are closed. ['sir', 'You'] do not fear, ['he', 'I'] imagine, that these gentlemen could stave in walls on which the balls of your frigate have had no effect?” 
 
“No, Captain; but a danger still exists.” 
 
“What is that, sir?” 
 
“It is that to-morrow, at about this hour, we must open the hatches to renew the air of the _Nautilus_. Now, if, at this moment, ['the Papuans', 'them'] should occupy the platform, I do not see how you could prevent ['the Papuans', 'them'] from entering.” 
 
“Then, ['sir', 'you'], ['sir', 'you'] suppose that they will board us?” 
 
“I am certain of it.” 
 
“Well, sir, let ['them', 'them', 'these Papuans', 'these wretches'] come. ['I', 'I', 'my'] see no reason for hindering ['them', 'them', 'these Papuans', 'these wretches']. After all, ['them', 'them', 'these Papuans', 'these wretches'] are poor creatures, and ['I', 'I', 'my'] am unwilling that ['I', 'I', 'my'] visit to the island should cost the life of a single one of ['them', 'them', 'these Papuans', 'these wretches'].” 
 
Upon that ['I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'the Canadian'] was going away; But ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'He', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself'] detained ['I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'the Canadian'], and asked ['I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'the Canadian'] to sit down by ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'He', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself']. ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'He', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself'] questioned ['I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'the Canadian'] with interest about ['our', 'our'] excursions on shore, and ['our', 'our'] hunting; and seemed not to understand the craving for meat that possessed ['I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'the Canadian']. Then the conversation turned on various subjects, and, without being more communicative, ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'He', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself'] showed ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'He', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself'] more amiable. 
 
Amongst other things, we happened to speak of the situation of the _Nautilus_, run aground in exactly the same spot in this strait where Dumont d’Urville was nearly lost. Apropos of this: 
 
“['This D’Urville', 'He', 'Unfortunate man of science', 'this energetic man', 'his', 'his'] was one of ['your', 'your', 'you Frenchmen'] great sailors,” said the Captain to ['me', 'you'], “one of ['your', 'your', 'you Frenchmen'] most intelligent navigators. ['This D’Urville', 'He', 'Unfortunate man of science', 'this energetic man', 'his', 'his'] is the Captain Cook of ['your', 'your', 'you Frenchmen']. ['This D’Urville', 'He', 'Unfortunate man of science', 'this energetic man', 'his', 'his'], after having braved the icebergs of the South Pole, the coral reefs of Oceania, the cannibals of the Pacific, to perish miserably in a railway train! If ['This D’Urville', 'He', 'Unfortunate man of science', 'this energetic man', 'his', 'his'] could have reflected during the last moments of ['This D’Urville', 'He', 'Unfortunate man of science', 'this energetic man', 'his', 'his'] life, what must have been uppermost in ['This D’Urville', 'He', 'Unfortunate man of science', 'this energetic man', 'his', 'his'] last thoughts, do ['me', 'you'] suppose?” 
 
So speaking, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'the French navigator', 'his', 'his'] seemed moved, and ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'the French navigator', 'his', 'his'] emotion gave me a better opinion of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'the French navigator', 'his', 'his']. Then, chart in hand, we reviewed the travels of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'the French navigator', 'his', 'his'], ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'the French navigator', 'his', 'his'] voyages of circumnavigation, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'the French navigator', 'his', 'his'] double detention at the South Pole, which led to the discovery of Adelaide and Louis Philippe, and fixing the hydrographical bearings of the principal islands of Oceania. 
 
“That which ['your D’Urville', 'he'] has done on the surface of ['the seas', 'them'],” said ['Captain Nemo', 'I'], “that have ['Captain Nemo', 'I'] done under ['the seas', 'them'], and more easily, more completely than ['your D’Urville', 'he']. The Astrolabe and the Zelee, incessantly tossed about by the hurricane, could not be worth ['the _Nautilus_, quiet repository of labour that she is, t['the _Nautilus_, quiet repository of labour that she is, truly motionless in the midst of the waters', 'she']y motionless in the midst of the waters', 'she']. 
 
“To-morrow,” added the Captain, rising, “to-morrow, at twenty minutes to three p.m., the _Nautilus_ shall float, and leave the Strait of Torres uninjured.” 
 
Having curtly pronounced these words, Captain Nemo bowed slightly. This was to dismiss ['me', 'I', 'my'], and ['me', 'I', 'my'] went back to ['me', 'I', 'my'] room. 
 
There ['I', 'my'] found Conseil, who wished to know the result of ['I', 'my'] interview with the Captain. 
 
“['My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] boy,” said ['My', 'I', 'I', 'me'], “when ['My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] feigned to believe that ['his _Nautilus_', 'him'] was threatened by the natives of Papua, ['the Captain', 'I'] answered ['My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] very sarcastically. ['the Captain', 'I'] have but one thing to say to you: Have confidence in ['his _Nautilus_', 'him'], and go to sleep in peace.” 
 
“Have ['you', 'sir'] no need of my services, ['you', 'sir']?” 
 
“No, my friend. What is Ned Land doing?” 
 
“If ['you', 'me', 'sir', 'Conseil'] will excuse ['you', 'me', 'sir', 'Conseil'], ['you', 'me', 'sir', 'Conseil'],” answered ['you', 'me', 'sir', 'Conseil'], “friend Ned is busy making a kangaroo-pie which will be a marvel.” 
 
['I', 'I'] remained alone and went to bed, but slept indifferently. ['I', 'I'] heard the noise of ['the savages, who stamped on the platform, uttering deafening cries', 'these cannibals']. The night passed thus, without disturbing the ordinary repose of ['the crew', 'them']. The presence of ['the savages, who stamped on the platform, uttering deafening cries', 'these cannibals'] affected ['the crew', 'them'] no more than the soldiers of ['a masked battery', 'its'] care for the ants that crawl over ['a masked battery', 'its'] front. 
 
At six in the morning I rose. The hatches had not been opened. The inner air was not renewed, but the reservoirs, filled ready for any emergency, were now resorted to, and discharged several cubic feet of oxygen into the exhausted atmosphere of the _Nautilus_. 
 
['I', 'my'] worked in ['I', 'my'] room till noon, without having seen Captain Nemo, even for an instant. On board no preparations for departure were visible. 
 
I waited still some time, then went into the large saloon. The clock marked half-past two. In ten minutes it would be high-tide: and, if Captain Nemo had not made a rash promise, ['the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'her'] would be immediately detached. If not, many months would pass ere ['the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'her'] could leave ['the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'her'] bed of coral. 
 
However, some warning vibrations began to be felt in the vessel. I heard the keel grating against the rough calcareous bottom of the coral reef. 
 
At five-and-twenty minutes to three, Captain Nemo appeared in the saloon. 
 
“We are going to start,” said he. 
 
“Ah!” replied I. 
 
“I have given the order to open the hatches.” 
 
“And the Papuans?” 
 
“The Papuans?” answered ['Captain Nemo', 'his'], slightly shrugging ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] shoulders. 
 
“Will they not come inside the _Nautilus?_” 
 
“How?” 
 
“Only by leaping over the hatches you have opened.” 
 
“M. Aronnax,” quietly answered Captain Nemo, “they will not enter ['the hatches of the _Nautilus_', 'they'] in that way, even if ['the hatches of the _Nautilus_', 'they'] were open.” 
 
I looked at the Captain. 
 
“You do not understand?” said he. 
 
“Hardly.” 
 
“Well, come and you will see.” 
 
['I', 'my'] directed ['I', 'my'] steps towards the central staircase. There Ned Land and Conseil were slyly watching some of the ship’s crew, who were opening the hatches, while cries of rage and fearful vociferations resounded outside. 
 
The port lids were pulled down outside. Twenty horrible faces appeared. But ['the first native who placed his hand ['the first native who placed his hand on the stair-rail, struck from behind by some invisible force, I know not what', 'his']the stair-rail, struck from behind by some invisible force, I know not what', 'his'], fled, uttering the most fearful cries and making the wildest contortions. 
 
Ten of ['his', 'him'] companions followed ['his', 'him']. They met with the same fate. 
 
Conseil was in ecstasy. ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his'], carried away by ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his'] violent instincts, rushed on to the staircase. But the moment ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his'] seized the rail with both hands, ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his'], in ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his'] turn, was overthrown. 
 
“['I', 'he'] am struck by a thunderbolt,” cried ['I', 'he'], with an oath. 
 
This explained all. ['It', 'it'] was no rail; but a metallic cable charged with electricity from the deck communicating with the platform. Whoever touched ['It', 'it'] felt ['a powerful shock', 'this shock']—and ['a powerful shock', 'this shock'] would have been mortal if ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'himself', 'he'] had discharged into the conductor the whole force of the current. It might truly be said that between ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'himself', 'he'] assailants and ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'himself', 'he'] ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'himself', 'he'] had stretched a network of electricity which none could pass with impunity. 
 
Meanwhile, the exasperated Papuans had beaten a retreat paralysed with terror. As for ['us', 'we'], half laughing, ['us', 'we'] consoled and rubbed the unfortunate Ned Land, who swore like one possessed. 
 
But at this moment ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'Her', 'Her', 'she'], raised by the last waves of the tide, quitted ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'Her', 'Her', 'she'] coral bed exactly at the fortieth minute fixed by the Captain. ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'Her', 'Her', 'she'] screw swept the waters slowly and majestically. ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'Her', 'Her', 'she'] speed increased gradually, and, sailing on the surface of the ocean, ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'Her', 'Her', 'she'] quitted safe and sound the dangerous passes of the Straits of Torres. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXII “ÆGRI SOMNIA” 
 
The following day 10th January, ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'her'] ['continued', 'it'] ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'her'] course between two seas, but with such remarkable speed that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] could not estimate ['continued', 'it'] at less than thirty-five miles an hour. The rapidity of ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'he['her screw', 'its', 'this marvellous electric agent'] was such that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] could neither follow nor count ['her screw', 'its', 'this marvellous electric agent'] revolutions. When ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] reflected that ['her screw', 'its', 'this marvellous electric agent'], after having afforded motion, heat, and light to ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'her'], still protected ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'her'] from outward attack, and transformed ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'her'] into an ark of safety which no profane hand might touch without being thunderstricken, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my['my admiration', 'it'] was unbounded, and from ['the structure', 'it'] ['my admiration', 'it'] extended to the engineer who had called ['the structure', 'it'] into existence. 
 
['Our', 'we', 'we'] course was directed to the west, and on the 11th of January ['Our', 'we', 'we'] doubled Cape Wessel, situation in 135° long. and 10° S. lat., which forms the east point of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The reefs were still numerous, but more equalised, and marked on the chart with extreme precision. The _Nautilus_ easily avoided the breakers of Money to port and the Victoria reefs to starboard, placed at 130° long. and on the 10th parallel, which ['Our', 'we', 'we'] strictly followed. 
 
On the 13th of January, Captain Nemo arrived in the Sea of Timor, and recognised the island of that name in 122° long. 
 
From this point the direction of ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'his _Nautilus_'] inclined towards the south-west. ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'his _Nautilus_'] head was set for the Indian Ocean. Where would the fancy of ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his'] carry us next? Would ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his'] return to the coast of Asia or would ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his'] approach again the shores of Europe? Improbable conjectures both, to a man who fled from inhabited continents. Then would ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his'] descend to the south? Was ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his'] going to double the Cape of Good Hope, then Cape Horn, and finally go as far as the Antarctic pole? Would ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his'] come back at last to the Pacific, where ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'hi['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his']Nautilus_'] could sail free and independently? Time would show. 
 
After having skirted the sands of Cartier, of Hibernia, Seringapatam, and Scott, last efforts of the solid against the liquid element, on the 14th of January we lost sight of land altogether. The speed of ['the _Nautilus_', 'she'] was considerably abated, and with irregular course ['the _Nautilus_', 'she'] sometimes swam in the bosom of ['the waters', 'their'], sometimes floated on ['the waters', 'their'] surface. 
 
During this period of the voyage, ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his', 'him'] made ['some interesting experiments on the varied temperature of the sea, in different be['the sea', 'the sea']hese observations']. Under ordinary conditions ['some interesting experiments on the varied temperature of the sea, in different beds', 'these observations'] are made by means of rather complicated instruments, and with somewhat doubtful results, by means of thermometrical sounding-leads, the glasses often breaking under the pressure of the water, or an apparatus grounded on the variations of the resistance of metals to the electric currents. Results so obtained could not be correctly calculated. On the contrary, ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his', 'him'] went ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his', 'him'] to test the temperature in the depths of ['the sea', 'the sea'], and ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his', 'him'] thermometer, placed in communication with the different sheets of water, gave ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his', 'him'] the required degree immediately and accurately. 
 
It was thus that, either by overloading ['her', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_'] reservoirs or by descending obliquely by means of ['her', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_'] inclined planes, ['her', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_'] successively ['attained', 'this experience'] the depth of three, four, five, seven, nine, and ten thousand yards, and the definite result of ['attained', 'this experience'] was that the sea preserved an average temperature of four degrees and a half at a depth of five thousand fathoms under all latitudes. 
 
On the 16th of January, ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'her', 'her', 'the machine'] seemed becalmed only a few yards beneath the surface of the waves. ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'her', 'her', 'the machine'] electric apparatus remained inactive and ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'her', 'her', 'the machine'] motionless screw left ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'her', 'her', 'the machine'] to drift at the mercy of the currents. I supposed that the crew was occupied with interior repairs, rendered necessary by the violence of the mechanical movements of ['the _Nautilus_', 'Her', 'her', 'her', 'the machine']. 
 
['My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my'] companions and ['My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my'] then witnessed a curious spectacle. The hatches of the saloon were open, and, as ['the beacon light of the _Nautilus_', 'the b['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'herself'] was not in action, a dim obscurity reigned in the midst of the waters. ['My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my'] observed the state of the sea, under these conditions, and the largest fish appeared to ['My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my'] no more than scarcely defined shadows, when ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'herself'] found ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'herself'] suddenly transported into full light. ['My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my'] thought at first that ['the beacon light of the _Nautilus_', 'the beacon', 'its'] had been lighted, and was casting ['the beacon light of the _Nautilus_', 'the beacon', 'its'] electric radiance into the liquid mass. ['My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my'] was mistaken, and after a rapid survey perceived ['My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my'] error. 
 
['The _Nautilus_', 'the vessel'] floated in the midst of ['a phosphorescent bed which, in this obscurity, became quite dazzling', 'It']. ['a phosphorescent bed which, in this obscurity, became quite dazzling', 'It'] was produced by ['myriads of luminous animalculae, whose brilliancy was increased as they glided over the metallic hull of the v['myriads of luminous animalculae, whose brilliancy was increased as they glided over the metallic hull of the vessel', 'they', 'these luminous sheets', 'they']l', 'they', 'these luminous sheets['The _Nautilus_', 'the vessel']. I was surprised by lightning in the midst of ['myriads of luminous animalculae, whose brilliancy was increased as they glided over the metallic hull of the vessel', 'they', 'these luminous sheets', 'they'], as though ['myriads of luminous animalculae, whose brilliancy was increased as they glided over the metallic hull of the vessel', 'they', 'these luminous sheets', 'they'] had been rivulets of lead melted in an ardent furnace or metallic masses brought to a white heat, so that, by force of contrast, certain portions of light appeared to cast a shade in the midst of the general ignition, from which all shade seemed banished. No; this was not the calm irradiation of our ordinary lightning. There was unusual life and vigour: this was truly living light! 
 
In reality, it was an infinite agglomeration of coloured infusoria, of veritable globules of jelly, provided with a threadlike tentacle, and of which as many as twenty-five thousand have been counted in less than two cubic half-inches of water. 
 
During several hours ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] floated in ['these brilliant waves', 'the waves'], and ['our', 'we'] admiration increased as ['our', 'we'] watched ['the marine monsters', 'themselves'] ['disporting', 'this phenomenon'] ['the marine monsters', 'themselves'] like salamanders. I saw there in the midst of this fire that burns not the swift and elegant porpoise (the indefatigable clown of the ocean), and some swordfish ten feet long, those prophetic heralds of the hurricane whose formidable sword would now and then strike the glass of the saloon. Then appeared the smaller fish, the balista, the leaping mackerel, wolf-thorn-tails, and a hundred others which striped the luminous atmosphere as they swam. This dazzling spectacle was enchanting! Perhaps some atmospheric condition increased the intensity of ['disporting', 'this phenomenon']. Perhaps some storm agitated the surface of ['these brilliant waves', 'the waves']. But at this depth of some yards, ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] was unmoved by ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] fury and reposed peacefully in still water. 
 
So ['we', 'we', 'our'] progressed, incessantly charmed by some new marvel. ['The days', 'them'] passed rapidly away, and ['I', 'I'] took no account of ['The days', 'them']. Ned, according to habit, tried to vary the diet on board. Like snails, ['we', 'we', 'our'] were fixed to ['we', 'we', 'our'] shells, and ['I', 'I'] declare it is easy to lead a snail’s life. 
 
Thus this life seemed easy and natural, and ['we', 'we', 'us', 'our'] thought no longer of the life ['we', 'we', 'us', 'our'] led on land; but something happened to recall ['we', 'we', 'us', 'our'] to the strangeness of ['we', 'we', 'us', 'our'] situation. 
 
On ['the 18th of January', 'this day'], the _Nautilus_ was in 105° long. and 15° S. lat. The weather was threatening, the sea rough and rolling. There was a strong east wind. The barometer, which had been going down for some days, foreboded a coming storm. ['I', 'I'] went up on to the platform just as the second lieutenant was taking the measure of the horary angles, and waited, according to habit till ['the daily phrase', 'it'] was said. But on ['the 18th of January', 'this day'] ['the daily phrase', 'it'] was exchanged for another phrase not less incomprehensible. Almost directly, ['I', 'I'] saw Captain Nemo appear with a glass, looking towards the horizon. 
 
For some minutes ['he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his'] was immovable, without taking ['he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his'] eye off the point of observation. Then ['he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his'] lowered ['he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his'] glass and exchanged a few words with ['he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'hi['his lieutenant', 'The latter', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'He', 'the lieutenant']. ['his lieutenant', 'The latter', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'He', 'the lieutenant'] seemed to be a victim to some emotion that ['his lieutenant', 'The latter', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'He', 'the lieutenant'] tried in vain to repress. ['his lieutenant', 'The latter', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'He', 'the lieutenant'], having more command over ['his lieutenant', 'The latter', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'He', 'the lieutenant'], was cool. ['his lieutenant', 'The latter', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'He', 'the lieutenant'] seemed, too, to be making some objections to which ['his lieutenant', 'The latter', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'He', 'the lieutenant'] replied by formal assurances. At least ['I', 'myself', 'I'] concluded so by the difference of their tones and gestures. For ['I', 'myself', 'I'], ['I', 'myself', 'I'] had looked carefully in the direction indicated without seeing anything. The sky and water were lost in the clear line of the horizon. 
 
However, ['Captain Nemo', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he'] walked from one end of the platform to the other, without looking at ['me', 'me'], perhaps without seeing ['me', 'me']. ['Captain Nemo', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he'] step was firm, but less regular than usual. ['Captain Nemo', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he'] stopped sometimes, crossed ['Captain Nemo', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he'] arms, and observed the sea. What could ['Captain Nemo', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he'] be looking for on that immense expanse? 
 
The _Nautilus_ was then some hundreds of miles from the nearest coast. 
 
['The lieutenant', 'his', 'his'] had taken up the glass and examined the horizon steadfastly, going and coming, stamping ['The lieutenant', 'his', 'his'] foot and showing more nervous agitation than ['The lieutenant', 'his', 'his'] superior officer. Besides, this mystery must necessarily be solved, and before long; for, upon an order from Captain Nemo, ['the engine', 'its'], increasing ['the engine', 'its'] propelling power, made the screw turn more rapidly. 
 
Just then the lieutenant drew ['the Captain’s', 'The latter', 'his', 'He'] attention again. ['the Captain’s', 'The latter', 'his', 'He'] stopped walking and directed ['the Captain’s', 'The latter', 'his', 'He'] glass towards the place indicated. ['the Captain’s', 'The latter', 'his', 'He'] looked long. ['I', 'I', 'myself'] felt very much puzzled, and descended to the drawing-room, and took out an excellent telescope that ['I', 'I', 'myself'] generally used. Then, leaning on the cage of the watch-light that jutted out from the front of the platform, set ['I', 'I', 'myself'] to look over all the line of the sky and sea. 
 
But ['my eye',['my', 'my']it'] was no sooner applied to the glass than ['my eye', 'it'] was quickly snatched out of ['my', 'my'] hands. 
 
['I', 'me', 'I', 'My'] turned round. ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his'] was before ['I', 'me', 'I', 'My'], but ['I', 'me', 'I', 'My'] did not know ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his']. ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his'] face was transfigured. ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his'] eyes flashed sullenly; ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his'] teeth were set; ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his'] stiff body, clenched fists, and head shrunk between ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his'] shoulders, betrayed the violent agitation that pervaded ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his'] whole frame. ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his'] did not move. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'My'] glass, fallen from ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his'] hands, had rolled at ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his'] feet. 
 
Had ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me'] unwittingly provoked ['this fit of anger', 'this hatred']? Did ['this incomprehensible person', 'he', 'his'] imagine that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me'] had discovered some forbidden secret? No; ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me'] was not the object of ['this fit of anger', 'this hatred'], for ['this incomprehensible person', 'he', 'his'] was not looking at ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me']; ['this incomprehensible person', 'he', 'his'] eye was steadily fixed upon the impenetrable point of the horizon. At last ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'I', 'me'] recovered ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'I', 'me']. ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'I', 'me'] agitation subsided. ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'I', 'me'] addressed some words in a foreign language to ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'I', 'm['his lieutenant', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'], then turned to ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me']. “['his lieutenant', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'],” ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'I', 'me'] said, in rather an imperious tone, “['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'I', 'me'] require ['his lieutenant', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'] to keep one of the conditions that bind ['his lieutenant', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'] to ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'I', 'me'].” 
 
“What is it, Captain?” 
 
“['You', 'your', 'you'] must be confined, with ['You', 'your', 'you'] companions, until I think fit to release ['You', 'your', 'you'].” 
 
“['You', 'him', 'you'] are the master,” ['I', 'I'] replied, looking steadily at ['You', 'him', 'you']. “But may ['I', 'I'] ask ['You', 'him', 'you'] one question?” 
 
“None, sir.” 
 
There was no resisting ['this imperious command', 'it'], ['this imperious command', 'it'] would have been useless. I went down to the cabin occupied by ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'them'], and told ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'them'] the Captain’s determination. You may judge how this communication was received by the Canadian. 
 
But there was not time for altercation. Four of the crew waited at the door, and conducted ['us', 'we', 'our'] to that cell where ['us', 'we', 'our'] had passed ['us', 'we', 'our'] first night on board the _Nautilus_. 
 
['Ned Land', 'him'] would have remonstrated, but the door was shut upon ['Ned Land', 'him']. 
 
“Will master tell ['me', 'Conseil'] what this means?” asked ['me', 'Conseil']. 
 
['I', 'my', 'I'] told ['I', 'my', 'I['my companions', 'They'] what had ['passed', 'it']. ['my companions', 'They'] were as much astonished as ['I', 'my', 'I'], and equally at a loss how to account for ['passed', 'it']. 
 
Meanwhile, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] was absorbed in ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] own reflections, and could think of nothing but ['the strange fear depicted in the Captain’s countenance', 'it']. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] was utterly at a loss to account for ['the strange fear depicted in the Captain’s countenance', 'it'], when ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] cogitations were disturbed by these words from Ned Land: 
 
“Hallo! breakfast is ready.” 
 
And indeed the table was laid. Evidently ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] had given this order at the same time that ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] had hastened the speed of the _Nautilus_. 
 
“Will master permit ['me', 'Conseil'] to make a recommendation?” asked ['me', 'Conseil']. 
 
“Yes, my boy.” 
 
“Well, it is that master breakfasts. It is prudent, for we do not know what may happen.” 
 
“You are right, Conseil.” 
 
“Unfortunately,” said Ned Land, “they have only given us the ship’s fare.” 
 
“Friend Ned,” asked ['Conseil', 'you'], “what would ['Conseil', 'you'] have said if the breakfast had been entirely forgotten?” 
 
This argument cut short the harpooner’s recriminations. 
 
We sat down to table. The meal was eaten in silence. 
 
Just then the luminous globe that lighted the cell went out, and left ['us', 'we', 'us'] in total darkness. Ned Land was soon asleep, and what astonished ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] was that ['Conseil', 'his'] went off into a heavy slumber. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] was thinking what could have caused ['Conseil', 'his'] irresistible drowsiness, when ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] felt ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] brain becoming stupefied. In spite of ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] efforts to keep ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me['my eyes', 'they', 'my eyes', 'them'] open, ['my eyes', 'they', 'my eyes', 'them'] would close. A painful suspicion seized ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me']. Evidently soporific substances had been mixed with the food ['us', 'we', 'us'] had just taken. Imprisonment was not enough to conceal Captain Nemo’s projects from ['us', 'we', 'us'], sleep was more necessary. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] then heard the panels shut. The undulations of the sea, which caused a slight rolling motion, ceased. Had ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] quitted the surface of the ocean? Had ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] gone back to the motionless bed of water? ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] tried to resist ['sleep', 'It']. ['sleep', 'It'] was impossible. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] breathing grew weak. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] felt a mortal cold freeze ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] stiffened and half-paralysed limbs. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] eye lids, like leaden caps, fell over ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me['my eyes', 'they', 'my eyes', 'them']. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] could not raise ['my eyes', 'they', 'my eyes', 'them']; a morbid sleep, full of hallucinations, bereft ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] of ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] being. Then the visions disappeared, and left ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me'] in complete insensibility. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXIII THE CORAL KINGDOM 
 
The next day ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I'] woke with ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I'] head singularly clear. To ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I'] great surprise, ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I'] was in ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I'] own room. ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I['My companions', 'their', 'they'], no doubt, had been reinstated in ['My companions', 'their', 'they'] cabin, without having perceived it any more than I. Of what had passed during the night ['My companions', 'their', 'they'] were as ignorant as ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I'] was, and to penetrate this mystery ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I'] only reckoned upon the chances of the future. 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] then thought of quitting ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] room. Was ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] free again or a prisoner? Quite free. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] opened the door, went to the half-deck, went up the central stairs. The panels, shut the evening before, were open. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] went on to the platform. 
 
['Ned Land and Conseil', 'them', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves', 'their'] waited there for ['me', 'I']. ['me', 'I'] questioned ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'them', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves', 'their']; ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'them', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves', 'their'] knew nothing. Lost in a heavy sleep in which ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'them', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves', 'their'] had been totally unconscious, ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'them', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves', 'their'] had been astonished at finding ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'them', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves', 'their'] in ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'them', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'themselves', 'their'] cabin. 
 
As for ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'It'], ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'It'] seemed quiet and mysterious as ever. ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'It'] floated on the surface of the waves at a moderate pace. Nothing seemed changed on board. 
 
The second lieutenant then came on to the platform, and gave the usual order below. 
 
As for ['Captain Nemo', 'he'], ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] did not appear. 
 
Of the people on board, ['I', 'me'] only saw ['the impassive steward, who served me with h['I', 'me'] usual['the impassive steward, who served me with his usual dumb regularity', 'his']mb regularity', 'his']. 
 
About two o’clock, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] was in the drawing-room, busied in arranging ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] notes, when ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] opened the door and appeared. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] bowed. ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] made a slight inclination in return, without speaking. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] resumed ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] work, hoping that ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] would perhaps give ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] some explanation of the events of the preceding night. ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] made none. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] looked at ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he']. ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] seemed fatigued; ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] heavy eyes had not been refreshed by sleep; ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] face looked very sorrowful. ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] walked to and fro, sat down and got up again, took ['a chance book', 'it'], put ['a chance book', 'it'] down, consulted ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] instruments without taking ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] habitual notes, and seemed restless and uneasy. At last, ['the Captain', 'He', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] came up to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'], and said: 
 
“Are ['you', 'M. Aronnax'] a doctor, ['you', 'M. Aronnax']?” 
 
['I', 'I'] so little expected such a question that ['I', 'I'] stared some time at him without answering. 
 
“Are ['you', 'he', 'your'] a doctor?” ['you', 'he', 'your'] repeated. “Several of ['you', 'he', 'your'] colleagues have studied medicine.” 
 
“Well,” said ['I', 'I', 'I'], “['I', 'I', 'I'] am a doctor and resident surgeon to the hospital. ['I', 'I', 'I'] practised several years before entering the museum.” 
 
“Very well, sir.” 
 
['My', 'I', 'my'] answer had evidently satisfied ['the Captain', 'he']. But, not knowing what ['the Captain', 'he'] would say next, ['My', 'I', 'my'] waited for other questions, reserving ['My', 'I', 'my'] answers according to circumstances. 
 
“['M. Aronnax', 'you'], will ['M. Aronnax', 'you'] consent to prescribe for one of ['my', 'he'] men?” ['my', 'he'] asked. 
 
“Is he ill?” 
 
“Yes.” 
 
“I am ready to follow you.” 
 
“Come, then.” 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] own ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] heart beat, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] do not know why. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] saw ['certain connection between the illness of one of the crew an['one of the crew', 'the sick man'] the day before', 'this mystery']; and ['certain connection between the illness of one of the crew and the events of the day before', 'this mystery'] interested ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] at least as much as ['one of the crew', 'the sick man']. 
 
Captain Nemo conducted ['me', 'me'] to the poop of the _Nautilus_, and took ['me', 'me'] into a cabin situated near the sailors’ quarters. 
 
There, on a bed, lay a man about forty years of age, with a resolute expression of countenance, a true type of an Anglo-Saxon. 
 
['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] leant over ['him', 'He', 'he', 'His', 'the wounded man', 'his']. ['him', 'He', 'he', 'His', 'the wounded man', 'his'] was not only ill, ['him', 'He', 'he', 'His', 'the wounded man', 'his'] was wounded. ['him', 'He', 'he', 'His', 'the wounded man', 'his'] head, swathed in ['bandages covered with blood', 'the bandages'], lay on a pillow. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] ['undid', 'it'] ['bandages covered with blood', 'the bandages'], and ['him', 'He', 'he', 'His', 'the wounded man', 'his'] looked at ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] with ['him', 'He', 'he', 'His', 'the wounded man', 'his'] large eyes and gave no sign of pain as ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] did ['undid', 'it']. It was a horrible wound. The skull, shattered by some deadly weapon, left the brain exposed, which was much injured. Clots of blood had formed in the bruised and broken mass, in colour like the dregs of wine. 
 
There was both contusion and suffusion of the brain. ['His', 'his', 'his', 'the unfortunate man’s', 'his'] breathing was slow, and some spasmodic movements of the muscles agitated ['His', 'his', 'his', 'the unfortunate man’s', 'his'] face. ['I', 'I', 'I'] felt ['His', 'his', 'his', 'the unfortunate man’s', 'hi['his pulse', 'It']. ['his pulse', 'It'] was intermittent. The extremities of the body were growing cold already, and ['I', 'I', 'I'] saw death must inevitably ensue. After dressing ['His', 'his', 'his', 'the unfortunate man’s', 'his'] wounds, ['I', 'I', 'I'] readjusted the bandages on ['His', 'his', 'his', 'the unfortunate man’s', 'his'] head, and turned to Captain Nemo. 
 
“What caused this wound?” I asked. 
 
“What does it signify?” ['he', 'myself', 'your'] replied, evasively. “A shock has broken one of the levers of the engine, which struck ['he', 'myself', 'your']. But ['he', 'myself', 'your'] opinion as to his state?” 
 
I hesitated before giving it. 
 
“['You', 'This man'] may speak,” said the Captain. “['You', 'This man'] does not understand French.” 
 
I gave a last look at the wounded man. 
 
“He will be dead in two hours.” 
 
“Can nothing save him?” 
 
“Nothing.” 
 
['Captain Nemo’s', 'his'] hand contracted, and some tears glistened in ['Captain Nemo’s', 'his'] eyes, which I thought incapable of shedding any. 
 
For some moments ['I', 'I', 'I'] still watched ['the dying man, whose life ebbed slowly', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his']. ['the dying man, whose life ebbed slowly', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] pallor increased under the electric light that was shed over ['the dying man, whose life ebbed slowly', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] death-bed. ['I', 'I', 'I'] looked at ['the dying man, whose life ebbed slowly', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] intelligent forehead, furrowed with premature wrinkles, produced probably by misfortune and sorrow. ['I', 'I', 'I'] tried to learn the secret of ['the dying man, whose life ebbed slowly', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] life from the last words that escaped ['the dying man, whose life ebbed slowly', 'His', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] lips. 
 
“You can go now, M. Aronnax,” said the Captain. 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] left him in the dying man’s cabin, and returned to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] room much affected by this scene. During the whole day, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was haunted by uncomfortable suspicions, and at night ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] slept badly, and between ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] broken dreams ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] fancied ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] heard ['distant sighs like the notes of a funeral psalm', 'they']. Were ['distant sighs like the notes of a funeral psalm', 'they'] the prayers of the dead, murmured in that language that ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could not understand? 
 
The next morning ['I', 'me', 'me', 'me'] went on to the bridge. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he'] was there before ['I', 'me', 'me', 'me']. As soon as ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he'] perceived ['I', 'me', 'me', 'me'] ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he'] came to ['I', 'me', 'me', 'me']. 
 
“['Professor', 'you'], will it be convenient to ['Professor', 'you'] to make a submarine excursion to-day?” 
 
“With ['my', 'I'] companions?” ['my', 'I'] asked. 
 
“If they like.” 
 
“We obey ['your', 'Captain'] orders, ['your', 'Captain'].” 
 
“Will ['you', 'your'] be so good then as to put on ['you', 'your'] cork jackets?” 
 
It was not a question of dead or dying. I rejoined ['Ned Land and Conseil', ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'the Canadian'], and told ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'them'] of ['Captain Nemo’s proposition', 'it']. ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'the Canadian'] hastened to accept ['Captain Nemo’s proposition', 'it'], and this time ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'the Canadian'] seemed quite willing to follow our example. 
 
It was eight o’clock in the morning. At half-past eight ['we', 'we'] were equipped for this new excursion, and provided with two contrivances for light and breathing. The double door was open; and, accompanied by Captain Nemo, who was followed by a dozen of the crew, ['we', 'we'] set foot, at a depth of about thirty feet, on the solid bottom on which the _Nautilus_ rested. 
 
A slight declivity ended in ['an uneven bottom, at fifteen fathoms depth', 'This bottom']. ['an uneven bottom, at fifteen fathoms depth', 'This bottom'] differed entirely from the one ['I', 'my', 'I'] had visited on ['I', 'my', 'I'] first excursion under the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Here, there was no fine sand, no submarine prairies, no sea-forest. ['I', 'my', 'I'] immediately recognised ['that marvellous region in which, on that day, the Captain did the honours to us', 'It']. ['that marvellous region in which, on that day, the Captain did the honours to us', 'It'] was the coral kingdom. 
 
The light produced ['a thousand charming varieties', 'their', 'these living flowers, these animated, sensitive plants', 'the flowers'], playing in the midst of the branches that were so vividly coloured. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] seemed to see the membraneous and cylindrical tubes tremble beneath the undulation of the waters. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] was tempted to gather ['a thousand charming varieties', 'their', 'these living flowers, these animated, sensitive plants', 'the flow['their fresh petals, ornamented with delicate tentacles, some just blown', 'them'], the others budding, while a small fish, swimming swiftly, touched ['their fresh petals, ornamented with delicate tentacles, some just blown', 'them'] slightly, like flights of birds. But if ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] hand approached ['a thousand charming varieties', 'their', 'these living flowers, these animated, sensitive plants', 'the flowers'], the whole colony took alarm. ['The white petals', 'their'] re-entered ['The white petals', 'their'] red cases, ['a thousand charming varieties', 'their', 'these living flowers, these animated, sensitive plants', 'the flowers'] faded as ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] looked, and the bush changed into a block of stony knobs. 
 
Chance had thrown ['me', 'I'] just by the most precious specimens of ['the zoophyte', 'This coral', 'Its']. ['the zoophyte', 'This coral', 'Its'] was more valuable than that found in the Mediterranean, on the coasts of France, Italy and Barbary. ['the zoophyte', 'This coral', 'Its'] tints justified the poetical names of “Flower of Blood,” and “Froth of Blood,” that ['trade', 'its'] has given to ['trade', 'its'] most beautiful productions. ['Coral', 'This precious matter, often confused with other polypi'] is sold for £20 per ounce; and in this place the watery beds would make the fortunes of a company of coral-divers. ['Coral', 'This precious matter, often confused with other polypi'], formed then the inextricable plots called “macciota,” and on which ['me', 'I'] noticed several beautiful specimens of pink coral. 
 
But soon the bushes contract, and the arborisations increase. Real petrified thickets, long joints of fantastic architecture, were disclosed before ['us', 'we', 'our']. ['Captain Nemo', 'himself'] placed ['Captain Nemo', 'himself'] under a dark gallery, where by a slight declivity ['us', 'we', 'our'] reached a depth of a hundred yards. The light from ['us', 'we', 'our'] lamps produced sometimes magical effects, following the rough outlines of the natural arches and pendants disposed like lustres, that were tipped with points of fire. 
 
At last, after walking two hours, ['we', 'We'] had attained a depth of about three hundred yards, that is to say, the extreme limit on which coral begins to form. But there was no isolated bush, nor modest brushwood, at the bottom of lofty trees. It was an immense forest of large mineral vegetations, ['enormous petrified trees', 'their'], united by garlands of elegant sea-bindweed, all adorned with clouds and reflections. ['we', 'We'] passed freely under ['enormous petrified trees', 'their'] high branches, lost in the shade of the waves. 
 
Captain Nemo had stopped. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] and ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] companions halted, and, turning round, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] saw ['his men', 'their', 'them'] were forming a semi-circle round ['his men', 'their', 'them'] chief. Watching attentively, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] observed that ['four of them', 'the['his men', 'their', 'them'] carried on ['four of them', 'their'] shoulders an object of an oblong shape. 
 
['We', 'Our'] occupied, in ['this place', 'this place'], the centre of ['a vast glade surrounded by the lofty foliage of the submarine forest', 'the glade']. ['We', 'Our'] lamps threw over ['this place', 'this place'] a sort of clear twilight that singularly elongated the shadows on the ground. At the end of ['a vast glade surrounded by the lofty foliage of the submarine forest', 'the glade'] the darkness increased, and was only relieved by little sparks reflected by the points of coral. 
 
Ned Land and Conseil were near ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I']. We watched, and ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] thought ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was going to witness a strange scene. On observing ['the ground', 'it'], ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw that ['the ground', 'it'] was raised in certain places by slight excrescences encrusted with limy deposits, and disposed with a regularity that betrayed the hand of man. 
 
In the midst of ['the glade', 'This glade'], on a pedestal of rocks roughly piled up, stood ['a cross of coral that extended its long arms that one['a cross of coral that extended its long arms that one might have thought were made of petrified blood', 'its', 'the cross']ght have thought were made of petrified blood', 'its', 'the cross']. Upon a sign from ['Captain Nemo', 'The Captain', 'his'] ['one of the men', 'he', 'he', 'his'] advanced; and at some feet from ['a cross of coral that extended its long arms that one might have thought were made of petrified blood', 'its', 'the cross'] ['one of the men', 'he', 'he', 'his'] began to dig ['a hole', 'this hole'] with a pickaxe that ['one of the men', 'he', 'he', 'his'] took from ['one of the men', 'he', 'he', 'his'] belt. I understood all! ['the glade', 'This glade'] was a cemetery, ['a hole', 'this hole'] a tomb, this oblong object the body of ['the man who had died in the night', 'their companion']! ['Captain Nemo', 'The Capta['The Captain and his men', '['Captain Nemo', 'The Captain', 'his']ir'] had come to bury ['The Captain and his men', 'th['the man who had died in the night', 'their companion'] in this general resting-place, at the bottom of this inaccessible ocean! 
 
['The grave', 'the damp grave'] was being dug slowly; ['the fish', 'their'] fled on all sides while ['the fish', 'their'] retreat was being thus disturbed; I heard the strokes of ['the pickaxe, which sparkled when it hit u['the pickaxe, which sparkled when it hit upon some flint lost at the bottom of the waters', 'it']n some flint lost at the bottom of the waters', 'it']. The hole was soon large and deep enough to receive ['the body', 'the body, enveloped in a tissue of white linen']. Then the bearers approached; ['the body', 'the body, enveloped in a tissue of white linen'], was lowered into ['The grave', 'the damp grave']. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'him'], with ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'him'] arms crossed on ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'him'] breast, and all the friends of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'him'] who had loved them, knelt in prayer. 
 
[Illustration] ['All', 'their'] fell on ['All', 'their'] knees in an attitude of prayer 
 
['The grave', 'the grave'] was then ['filled', 'this'] in with the rubbish taken from the ground, which formed a slight mound. When ['filled', 'this'] was done, ['Captain N['Captain Nemo and his men', 'they', 'all', '['Captain Nemo', 'his']ir'] rose; then, approaching ['The grave', 'the grave'], ['Captain Nemo and his men', 'they', 'all', 'their'] knelt again, and ['Captain Nemo and his men', 'they', 'all', 'their'] extended ['Captain Nemo and his men', 'they', 'all', 'their'] hands in sign of a last adieu. Then ['the funeral procession', 'us', 'we'] returned to ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'], passing under the arches of the forest, in the midst of thickets, along the coral bushes, and still on the ascent. At last the light of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] appeared, and ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] luminous track guided ['the funeral procession', 'us', 'we'] to ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_']. At one o’clock ['the funeral procession', 'us', 'we'] had returned. 
 
As soon as ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] had changed ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] clothes ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] went up on to the platform, and, a prey to conflicting emotions, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] sat down near the binnacle. ['Captain Nemo', 'him'] joined ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I']. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] rose and said to ['Captain Nemo', 'him']: 
 
“So, as I said ['he', 'this man'] would, ['he', 'this man'] died in the night?” 
 
“Yes, M. Aronnax.” 
 
“And ['he', 'his'] rests now, near ['he', 'his'] companions, in the coral cemetery?” 
 
“Yes, forgotten by all else, but not by ['us', 'We', 'our', 'Our']. ['us', 'We', 'our', 'Our'] dug the grave, and the polypi undertake to seal ['us', 'We', 'our', 'Our'] dead for eternity.” And, burying ['his', 'his', 'he', 'he'] face quickly in ['his', 'his', 'he', 'he'] hands, ['his', 'his', 'he', 'he'] tried in vain to suppress a sob. Then ['his', 'his', 'he', 'he'] added: “['us', 'We', 'our', 'Our'] peaceful cemetery is there, some hundred feet below the surface of the waves.” 
 
“['Your', 'Captain'] dead sleep quietly, at least, ['Your', 'Captain'], out of the reach of sharks.” 
 
“Yes, ['sir', 'the Captain'], of sharks and men,” gravely replied ['sir', 'the Captain']. 
 
 
 
PART TWO 
 
 
 
CHAPTER I THE INDIAN OCEAN 
 
['We', 'our'] now come to the second part of ['We', 'our'] journey under ['the sea', 'this great sea', 'its', 'the ocean’s']. The first ended with the moving scene in the coral cemetery which left such a deep impression on my mind. Thus, in the midst of ['the sea', 'this great sea', 'its', 'the ocean’s'], ['Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain'] life was passing, even to ['Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain'] grave, which ['Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain'] had prepared in one of ['the sea', 'this great sea', 'its', 'the ocean’s'] deepest abysses. There, not one of ['the sea', 'this great sea', 'its', 'the ocean’s'] monsters could trouble the last sleep of the crew of the _Nautilus_, of those friends riveted to each other in death as in life. “Nor any man, either,” had added ['Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain']. Still the same fierce, implacable defiance towards human society! 
 
['I', 'myself'] could no longer content ['I', 'myself'] with the theory which satisfied Conseil. 
 
['That worthy fellow', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'the man'] persisted in seeing in the Commander of the _Nautilus_ one of those unknown _savants_ who return mankind contempt for indifference. For ['That worthy fellow', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'the man'], ['That worthy fellow', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'the man'] ['was', 'this'] a misunderstood genius who, tired of earth’s deceptions, had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium, where ['That worthy fellow', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'the man'] might follow ['That worthy fellow', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'the man'] instincts freely. To ['my', 'my', 'I', 'me'] mind, ['was', 'this'] explains but one side of ['Captain Nemo’s', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'His', 'his'] character. Indeed, the mystery of that last night during which we had been chained in prison, the sleep, and the precaution so violently taken by ['Captain Nemo’s', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'His', 'his'] of snatching from ['my', 'my', 'I', 'me'] eyes the glass ['my', 'my', 'I', 'me'] had raised to sweep the horizon, the mortal wound of ['That worthy fellow', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'the man'], due to an unaccountable shock of the _Nautilus_, all put ['my', 'my', 'I', 'me'] on a new track. No; ['Captain Nemo’s', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'His', 'his'] was not satisfied with shunning man. ['Captain Nemo’s', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'His', 'his'] formidable apparatus not only suited ['Captain Nemo’s', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'His', 'his'] instinct of freedom, but perhaps also the design of some terrible retaliation. 
 
At this moment nothing is clear to ['me', 'I', 'I', 'myself']; ['me', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] catch but a glimpse of light amidst all the darkness, and ['me', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] must confine ['me', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] to writing as events shall dictate. 
 
That day, the 24th of January, 1868, at noon, ['the second officer', 'the man', 'him', 'he', 'he'] came to take the altitude of the sun. ['I', 'me', 'I'] mounted the platform, lit a cigar, and watched the operation. It seemed to ['I', 'me', 'I'] that ['the second officer', 'the man', 'him', 'he', 'he'] did not understand French; for several times ['I', 'me', 'I'] made ['remarks in a loud voice, which must have drawn from him some i['the second officer', 'the man', 'him', 'he', 'he']luntary sign of attention', 'them'], if ['the second officer', 'the man', 'him', 'he', 'he'] had understood ['remarks in a loud voice, which must have drawn from him some involuntary sign of attention', 'them']; but ['the second officer', 'the man', 'him', 'he', 'he'] remained undisturbed and dumb. 
 
As he was taking observations with the sextant, one of the sailors of ['the _Nautilus_ (the strong man who had accompanied us on our first submarine e['us', 'our']ursi['us', 'our']to the Island of Crespo)', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] came to clean the glasses of ['the lantern', 'The electric lamp', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its']. ['I', 'I'] examined the fittings of the apparatus, the strength of which was increased a hundredfold by ['lenticular rings, placed similar to those in a lighthouse, and which projected their brill['lenticular rings, placed similar to those in a lighthouse, and which projected their brilliance in a horizontal plane', 'their'] in a horizontal plane', 'their']. ['the lantern', 'The electric lamp', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its'] was combined in such a way as to give ['the lantern', 'The electric lamp', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its'] most powerful light. Indeed, ['the lantern', 'The electric lamp', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its'] was produced in ['vacuo, which insured both its steadiness an['the lantern', 'The electric lamp', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its']ts intensity', '['the lantern', 'The electric lamp', 'its', 'it', 'its', 'its']s vacuum']. ['vacuo, which insured both its steadiness and its intensity', 'This vacuum'] economised ['the graphite points between which the luminous arc was developed', 'them', 'their']—an important point of economy for Captain Nemo, who could not easily have replaced ['the graphite points between which the luminous arc was developed', 'them', 'their']; and under these conditions ['the graphite points between which the luminous arc was developed', 'them', 'their'] waste was imperceptible. When ['the _Nautilus_ (the strong man who had accompanied us on our first submarine excursion to the Island of Crespo)', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] was ready to continue ['the _Nautilus_ (the strong man who had accompanied us on our first submarine excursion to the Island of Crespo)', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] submarine journey, ['I', 'I'] went down to the saloon. The panel was closed, and the course marked direct west. 
 
['We', 'We'] were furrowing the waters of the Indian Ocean, a vast liquid plain, with a surface of 1,200,000,000 of acres, and whose waters are so clear and transparent that any one leaning over them would turn giddy. The _Nautilus_ usually floated between fifty and a hundred fathoms deep. ['We', 'We'] went on so for some days. To anyone but ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my memoirs, took up all my', 'my', 'me'], who had a great love for ['the sea', 'the ocean'], the hours would have seemed long and monotonous; but the daily walks on the platform, when ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my memoirs, took up all my', 'my', 'me'] steeped ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my memoirs, took up all my', 'my', 'me'] in the reviving air of ['the sea', 'the ocean'], the sight of the rich waters through the windows of the saloon, the books in the library, the compiling of ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my memoirs, took up all my', 'my', 'me['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my memoirs, took up all my', 'my', 'me['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my memoirs, took up all my', 'my', 'me'] time, and left ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'my memoirs, took up all my', 'my', 'me'] not a moment of ennui or weariness. 
 
For some days we saw a great number of aquatic birds, sea-mews or gulls. Some were cleverly killed and, prepared in a certain way, made very acceptable water-game. Amongst ['large-winged birds', 'their'], carried a long distance from all lands and resting upon the waves from the fatigue of ['large-winged birds', 'their'] flight, I saw some magnificent albatrosses, uttering discordant cries like the braying of an ass, and birds belonging to the family of the long-wings. 
 
As to ['the fish', 'they', 'their'], ['the fish', 'they', 'their'] always provoked ['our', 'we'] admiration when ['our', 'we'] surprised the secrets of ['the fish', 'they', 'their'] aquatic life through the open panels. ['I', 'I'] saw many kinds which ['I', 'I'] never before had a chance of observing. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] shall notice ['chiefly ostracions peculiar to the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and that part which washes the coast of tropical America', 'These fishes, like the tortoise, the armadillo, the sea-hedgehog, and the Crustacea']. ['chiefly ostracions peculiar to the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and that part which washes the coast of tropical America', 'These fishes, like the tortoise, the armadillo, the sea-hedgehog, and the Crustacea'], are protected by ['a breastplate which is neither chalky nor stony, but real bone', 'it']. In some ['a breastplate which is neither chalky nor stony, but real bone', 'it'] takes the form of a solid triangle, in others of a solid quadrangle. Amongst the triangular ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw ['some an inch and a half in length, with wholesome flesh and a delicious flavour', 'they', 'their']; ['some an inch and a half in length, with wholesome flesh and a delicious flavour', 'they', 'their'] are brown at the tail, and yellow at the fins, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] recommend ['some an inch and a half in length, with wholesome flesh and a delicious flavour', 'they', 'their'] introduction into fresh water, to which ['a certain number of sea-fish', 'themselves'] easily accustom ['a certain number of sea-fish', 'themselves']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] would also mention quadrangular ostracions, having on the back four large tubercles; some dotted over with white spots on the lower part of the body, and which may be tamed like birds; trigons provided with spikes formed by the lengthening of their bony shell, and which, from their strange gruntings, are called “seapigs”; also dromedaries with large humps in the shape of a cone, whose flesh is very tough and leathery. 
 
I now borrow from the daily notes of Master Conseil. “Certain fish of the genus petrodon peculiar to those seas, with red backs and white chests, which are distinguished by three rows of longitudinal filaments; and some electrical, seven inches long, decked in the liveliest colours. Then, as specimens of other kinds, some ovoides, resembling an egg of a dark brown colour, marked with white bands, and without tails; diodons, real sea-porcupines, furnished with spikes, and capable of swelling in such a way as to look like cushions bristling with darts; hippocampi, common to every ocean; some pegasi with lengthened snouts, which their pectoral fins, being much elongated and formed in the shape of wings, allow, if not to fly, at least to shoot into the air; pigeon spatulae, with tails covered with many rings of shell; macrognathi with long jaws, an excellent fish, nine inches long, and bright with most agreeable colours; pale-coloured calliomores, with rugged heads; and plenty of chaetpdons, with long and tubular muzzles, which kill ['insects', 'them'] by shooting ['insects', 'them'], as from an air-gun, with a single drop of water. These we may call the flycatchers of the seas. 
 
“In the eighty-ninth genus of fishes, classed by Lacepede, belonging to the second lower class of bony, characterised by opercules and bronchial membranes, I remarked ['the scorpaena, the head of which is furnished with spikes, and which has but one dorsal fin', 'these creatures', 'they']; ['the scorpaena, the head of which is furnished with spikes, and which has but one dorsal fin', 'these creatures', 'they'] are covered, or not, with little shells, according to ['the sub-class to which they belong', 'The second sub-cl['the scorpaena, the head of which is furnished with spikes, and which has but one dorsal fin', 'these creatures', 'they'], 'it']. ['the sub-class to which they belong', 'The second sub-class', 'it'] gives us specimens of didactyles fourteen or fifteen inches in length, with yellow rays, and heads of a most fantastic appearance. As to the first sub-class, ['the sub-class to which they belong', 'The second sub-class', 'it'] gives several specimens of that singular looking fish appropriately called a ‘seafrog,’ with large head, sometimes pierced with holes, sometimes swollen with protuberances, bristling with spikes, and covered with tubercles; ['it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] has irregular and hideous horns; ['it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] body and tail are covered with callosities; ['it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] sting makes a dangerous wound; ['it', 'its', 'its', 'it'] is both repugnant and horrible to look at.” 
 
From the 21st to the 23rd of January ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'Its'] went at the rate of two hundred and fifty leagues in twenty-four hours, being five hundred and forty miles, or twenty-two miles an hour. If ['we', 'us', 'our', 'we'] recognised ['so many different varieties of fish', 'they'], it was because, attracted by the electric light, ['so many different varieties of fish', 'they'] tried to follow ['we', 'us', 'our', 'we']; the greater part, however, were soon distanced by ['we', 'us', 'our', 'we'] speed, though ['some', 'their'] kept ['some', 'their'] place in the waters of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'Its'] for a time. The morning of the 24th, in 12° 5′ S. lat., and 94° 33′ long., ['we', 'us', 'our', 'we'] observed ['Keeling Island, a coral formation, planted with magnificent cocos, and which had been visited by Mr. Darwin and Captain Fitzroy', 'this desert island']. ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'Its'] skirted the shores of ['Keeling Island, a coral formation, planted with magnificent cocos, and which had been visited by Mr. Darwin and Captain Fitzroy', 'this desert island'] for a little distance. ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'Its'] nets brought up numerous specimens of polypi and curious shells of mollusca. Some precious productions of the species of delphinulae enriched the treasures of Captain Nemo, to which I added an astraea punctifera, a kind of parasite polypus often found fixed to a shell. 
 
Soon Keeling Island disappeared from the horizon, and our course was directed to the north-west in the direction of the Indian Peninsula. 
 
From Keeling Island ['our', 'us', 'we'] course was slower and more variable, often taking ['our', 'us', 'we'] into great depths. Several times they made use of the inclined planes, which certain internal levers placed obliquely to the waterline. In that way ['our', 'us', 'we'] went about two miles, but without ever obtaining the greatest depths of ['the Indian Sea', 'the sea'], which soundings of seven thousand fathoms have never reached. As to the temperature of the lower strata, the thermometer invariably indicated 4° above zero. I only observed that in the upper regions the water was always colder in the high levels than at the surface of ['the Indian Sea', 'the sea']. 
 
On ['the 25th of January', 'the day', 'this day'] ['the ocean', 'the sea'] was entirely deserted; ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this steamboat'] passed ['the 25th of January', 'the day', 'this day'] on the surface, beating ['the waves', 'them'] with ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this steamboat'] powerful screw and making ['the waves', 'them'] rebound to a great height. Who under such circumstances would not have taken ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this steamboat'] for a gigantic cetacean? Three parts of ['the 25th of January', 'the day', 'this day'] ['I', 'I', 'I'] spent on the platform. ['I', 'I', 'I'] watched ['the ocean', 'the sea']. Nothing on the horizon, till about four o’clock ['a steamer', 'Her', 'she'] running west on our counter. ['a steamer', 'Her', 'she'] masts were visible for an instant, but ['a steamer', 'Her', 'she'] could not see ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this steamboat'], being too low in the water. ['I', 'I', 'I'] fancied ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this steamboat'] belonged to the P.O. Company, which runs from Ceylon to Sydney, touching at King George’s Point and Melbourne. 
 
At five o’clock in the evening, before that fleeting twilight which binds night to day in tropical zones, Conseil and I were astonished by a curious spectacle. 
 
It was a shoal of argonauts travelling along on the surface of the ocean. We could count ['several hundreds', 'They']. ['several hundreds', 'They'] belonged to the tubercle kind which are peculiar to the Indian seas. 
 
['These graceful molluscs', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their'] moved backwards by means of ['These graceful molluscs', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their'] locomotive tube, through which ['These graceful molluscs', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their'] propelled the water already drawn in. Of ['These graceful molluscs', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their'] eight tentacles, six were elongated, and stretched out floating on the water, whilst the other two, rolled up flat, were spread to the wing like a light sail. I saw ['These graceful molluscs', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their'] spiral-shaped and fluted shells, which Cuvier justly compares to an elegant skiff. A boat indeed! ['It', 'it', 'it'] bears ['the creature which secretes it withou['It', 'it', 'it']its adher['the creature which secretes it without its adhering to it', 'its'] to it', 'its['It', 'it', 'it']. 
 
For nearly an hour the _Nautilus_ floated in the midst of this shoal of molluscs. Then I know not what sudden fright they took. But as if at a signal every sail was furled, the arms folded, the body drawn in, ['the shells', 'their'] turned over, changing ['the shells', 'their'] centre of gravity, and the whole fleet disappeared under the waves. Never did the ships of a squadron manœuvre with more unity. 
 
At that moment night fell suddenly, and the reeds, scarcely raised by the breeze, lay peaceably under the sides of the _Nautilus_. 
 
['The next day, 26th of January', 'the day'], ['we', 'us', 'us'] cut the equator at the eighty-second meridian and entered the northern hemisphere. During ['The next day, 26th of January', 'the day'] ['a formidable troop of sharks', 'They', 'their'] accompanied ['we', 'us', 'us'], terrible creatures, which multiply in ['these seas', 'them'] and make ['these seas', 'them'] very dangerous. ['a formidable troop of sharks', 'They', 'their'] were “cestracio philippi” sharks, with brown backs and whitish bellies, armed with eleven rows of teeth—eyed sharks—['a formidable troop of sharks', 'They', 'their'] throat being marked with a large black spot surrounded with white like an eye. There were also some Isabella sharks, with rounded snouts marked with dark spots. ['These powerful creatures', 'themselves'] often hurled ['These powerful creatures', 'themselves'] at the windows of the saloon with such violence as to make ['we', 'us', 'us'] feel very insecure. At such times ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'He', 'him'] was no longer master of ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'He', 'him']. ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'He', 'him'] wanted to go to the surface and harpoon the monsters, particularly certain smooth-hound sharks, whose mouth is studded with teeth like a mosaic; and large tiger-sharks nearly six yards long, the last named of which seemed to excite ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'He', 'him'] more particularly. But ['the _Nautilus_', 'her'], accelerating ['the _Nautilus_', 'her'] speed, easily left the most rapid of them behind. 
 
The 27th of January, at the entrance of the vast Bay of Bengal, we met repeatedly a forbidding spectacle, ['dead bodies', 'They', 'them', 'their'] floating on the surface of the water. ['dead bodies', 'They', 'them', 'their'] were the dead of the Indian villages, carried by the Ganges to the level of the sea, and which the vultures, the only undertakers of the country, had not been able to devour. But the sharks did not fail to help ['dead bodies', 'They', 'them', 'their'] at ['dead bodies', 'They', 'them', 'their'] funeral work. 
 
About seven o’clock in the evening, the _Nautilus_, half-immersed, was sailing in ['a sea of milk', 'the ocean']. At first sight ['a sea of milk', 'the ocean'] seemed lactified. Was it the effect of the lunar rays? No; for the moon, scarcely two days old, was still lying hidden under the horizon in the rays of the sun. The whole sky, though lit by the sidereal rays, seemed black by contrast with the whiteness of the waters. 
 
['Conseil', 'his', 'him'] could not believe ['Conseil', 'his', 'him'] eyes, and questioned ['me', 'I'] as to the cause of this strange phenomenon. Happily ['me', 'I'] was able to answer ['Conseil', 'his', 'him']. 
 
“['It', 'the sea'] is called a milk sea,” I explained. “A large extent of white wavelets often to be seen on the coasts of Amboyna, and in these parts of ['It', 'the sea'].” 
 
“But, ['sir', 'you'],” said ['Conseil', 'me', 'I'], “can ['sir', 'you'] tell ['Conseil', 'me', 'I'] what causes such an effect? for ['Conseil', 'me', 'I'] suppose the water is not really turned into milk.” 
 
“No, ['my boy', 'you']; and the whiteness which surprises ['my boy', 'you'] is caused only by the presence of myriads of infusoria, a sort of luminous little worm, gelatinous and without colour, of the thickness of a hair, and whose length is not more than seven-thousandths of an inch. These insects adhere to one another sometimes for several leagues.” 
 
“Several leagues!” exclaimed Conseil. 
 
“Yes, ['my boy', 'you', ['my', 'I']ou']; and ['my boy', 'you', 'You'] need not try to compute the number of these infusoria. ['my boy', 'you', 'You'] will not be able, for, if ['my', 'I'] am not mistaken, ships have floated on these milk seas for more than forty miles.” 
 
Towards midnight ['the sea', 'its'] suddenly resumed ['the sea', 'its'] usual colour; but behind us, even to the limits of the horizon, the sky reflected the whitened waves, and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague glimmerings of an aurora borealis. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER II A NOVEL PROPOSAL OF CAPTAIN NEMO’S 
 
On the 28th of February, when at noon the _Nautilus_ came to the surface of the sea, in 9° 4′ N. lat., there was land in sight about eight miles to westward. The first thing ['I', 'I'] noticed was a range of mountains about two thousand feet high, the shapes of which were most capricious. On taking the bearings, ['I', 'I'] knew that we were nearing the island of Ceylon, the pearl which hangs from the lobe of the Indian Peninsula. 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'The Captain'] and ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'The Captain'] second appeared at this moment. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'The Captain'] glanced at the map. Then turning to me, said: 
 
“['The Island of Ceylon', 'its', 'them'], noted for ['The Island of Ceylon', 'its', 'them'] pearl-fisheries. Would you like to visit one of ['The Island of Ceylon', 'its', 'them'], M. Aronnax?” 
 
“Certainly, Captain.” 
 
“Well, the thing is easy. Though, if ['we', 'we', 'we'] see the fisheries, ['we', 'we', 'we'] shall not see the fishermen. The annual exportation has not yet begun. Never mind, I will give orders to make for the Gulf of Manaar, where ['we', 'we', 'we'] shall arrive in the night.” 
 
['The Captain', 'his'] said something to ['The Captain', 'his'] second, who immediately went out. Soon ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'she'] returned to ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'she'] native element, and the manometer showed that ['the _Nautilus_', 'her', 'she'] was about thirty feet deep. 
 
“Well, ['sir', 'you', 'your'],” said Captain Nemo, “['sir', 'you', 'you['you and your com['sir', 'you', 'your']ons', 'we'] shall visit the Bank of Manaar, and if by chance ['some fisherman', 'him'] should be there, ['you and your companions', 'we'] shall see ['some fisherman', 'him'] at work.” 
 
“Agreed, Captain!” 
 
“By the bye, ['M. Aronnax', 'you'] ['M. Aronnax', 'you'] are not afraid of sharks?” 
 
“Sharks!” exclaimed I. 
 
This question seemed a very hard one. 
 
“Well?” continued Captain Nemo. 
 
“['I', 'I'] admit, Captain, that ['I', 'I'] am not yet very familiar with that kind of fish.” 
 
“['We', 'we', 'we'] are accustomed to them,” replied ['Captain Nemo', 'you', 'sir'], “and in time ['Captain Nemo', 'you', 'sir'] will be too. However, ['We', 'we', 'we'] shall be armed, and on the road ['We', 'we', 'we'] may be able to hunt some of the tribe. It is interesting. So, till to-morrow, ['Captain Nemo', 'you', 'sir'], and early.” 
 
This said in a careless tone, Captain Nemo left the saloon. Now, if you were invited to hunt the bear in the mountains of Switzerland, what would you say? 
 
“Very well! to-morrow we will go and hunt the bear.” If you were asked to hunt the lion in the plains of Atlas, or the tiger in the Indian jungles, what would you say? 
 
“Ha! ha! it seems ['we', 'us', 'our', 'we'] are going to hunt the tiger or the lion!” But when you are ['invited', 'the invitation'] to hunt ['the shark in its natur['the shark in its natural element', 'its']element', 'its'], you would perhaps reflect before accepting ['invited', 'the invitation']. As for ['myself', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'], ['myself', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] passed ['myself', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] hand over ['myself', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] forehead, on which stood large drops of cold perspiration. “Let ['we', 'us', 'our', 'we'] reflect,” said ['myself', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'], “and take ['we', 'us', 'our', 'we'] time. Hunting otters in submarine forests, as ['we', 'us', 'our', 'we'] did in the Island of Crespo, will pass; but going up and down at the bottom of the sea, where one is almost certain to meet ['sharks', 'them', 'those creatures'], is quite another thing! ['myself', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] know well that in certain countries, particularly in the Andaman Islands, the negroes never hesitate to attack ['sharks', 'them', 'those creatures'] with a dagger in one hand and a running noose in the other; but ['myself', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] also know that few who affront ['sharks', 'them', 'those creatures'] ever return alive. However, ['myself', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am not a negro, and if ['myself', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] were ['myself', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] think a little hesitation in this case would not be ill-timed.” 
 
At this moment ['Conseil and the Canadian', 'They', 'them'] entered, quite composed, and even joyous. ['Conseil and the Canadian', 'They', 'them'] knew not what awaited ['Conseil and the Canadian', 'They', 'them']. 
 
“Faith, ['sir', 'your'],” said Ned Land, “['sir', 'your'] Captain Nemo—the devil take him!—has just made us a very pleasant offer.” 
 
“Ah!” said I, “you know?” 
 
“If agreeable to ['you', 'sir', 'your'], ['you', 'sir', 'your'],” interrupted Conseil, “['the commander of the _Nautilus_', 'he'] has invited us to ['visit', 'it'] the magnificent Ceylon fisheries to-morrow, in ['you', 'sir', 'your'] company; ['the commander of the _Nautilus_', 'he'] did ['visit', 'it'] kindly, and behaved like a real gentleman.” 
 
“He said nothing more?” 
 
“Nothing more, ['sir', 'you'], except that he had already spoken to ['sir', 'you'] of this little walk.” 
 
“['Sir', 'you'],” said Conseil, “would ['Sir', 'you'] give us some details of the pearl fishery?” 
 
“As to the fishing itself,” I asked, “or the incidents, which?” 
 
“On the fishing,” replied the Canadian; “before entering upon ['the ground', 'it'], it is as well to know something about ['the ground', 'it'].” 
 
“Very well; sit down, ['my', 'I['my friends', 'you'], and ['my', 'I'] will teach ['my friends', 'you'].” 
 
['Ned and Conseil', 'themselves'] seated ['Ned and Conseil', 'themselves'] on an ottoman, and the first thing the Canadian asked was: 
 
“Sir, what is a pearl?” 
 
“['My', 'I'] worthy Ned,” ['My', 'I'] answered, “to the poet, ['a pearl', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] is a tear of the sea; to the Orientals, ['a pearl', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] is a drop of dew solidified; to ['the ladies', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their'], ['a pearl', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] is a jewel of an oblong shape, of a brilliancy of mother-of-pearl substance, which ['the ladies', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their'] wear on ['the ladies', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their'] fingers, ['the ladies', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their'] necks, or ['the ladies', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their'] ears; for the chemist ['a pearl', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] is a mixture of phosphate and carbonate of lime, with a little gelatine; and lastly, for naturalists, ['a pearl', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] is simply a morbid secretion of the organ that produces the mother-of-pearl amongst certain bivalves.” 
 
“Branch of molluscs,” said Conseil. 
 
“Precisely so, my learned Conseil; and, amongst these testacea the earshell, the tridacnae, the turbots, in a word, all those which secrete mother-of-pearl, that is, the blue, bluish, violet, or white substance which lines the interior of their shells, are capable of producing pearls.” 
 
“Mussels too?” asked the Canadian. 
 
“Yes, mussels of certain waters in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Saxony, Bohemia, and France.” 
 
“Good! For the future ['I', 'the Canadian'] shall pay attention,” replied ['I', 'the Canadian']. 
 
“But,” I continued, “the particular mollusc which secretes ['the pearl', 'The pearl', 'it', 'it'] is the pearl-oyster, the meleagrina margaritiferct, that precious pintadine. ['the pearl', 'The pearl', 'it', 'it'] is nothing but a nacreous formation, deposited in a globular form, either adhering to ['the oyster shell', 'the shell'], or buried in the folds of the creature. On ['the oyster shell', 'the shell'] ['the pearl', 'The pearl', 'it', 'it'] is fast; in the flesh ['the pearl', 'The pearl', 'it', 'it'] is loose; but always has for a kernel a small hard substance, may be a barren egg, may be a grain of sand, around which ['the pearly matter', 'itself'] deposits ['the pearly matter', 'itself'] year after year successively, and by thin concentric layers.” 
 
“Are many pearls found in the same oyster?” asked Conseil. 
 
“Yes, ['my', 'I', 'myself'] boy. Some are a perfect casket. One oyster has been mentioned, though ['my', 'I', 'myself'] allow ['my', 'I', 'myself'] to doubt it, as having contained no less than a hundred and fifty sharks.” 
 
“A hundred and fifty sharks!” exclaimed Ned Land. 
 
“Did ['I', 'I', 'I'] say sharks?” said ['I', 'I', 'I'] hurriedly. “['I', 'I', 'I'] meant to say a hundred and fifty pearls. Sharks would not be sense.” 
 
“Certainly not,” said ['Conseil', 'you']; “but will ['Conseil', 'you'] tell us now by what means they extract these pearls?” 
 
“['They', 'they', 'them', 'the oysters', 'they', 'they', 'They', 'they'] proceed in various ways. When ['They', 'they', 'them', 'the oysters', 'they', 'they', 'They', 'they'] adhere to the shell, the fishermen often pull ['They', 'they', 'them', 'the oysters', 'they', 'they', 'They', 'they'] off with pincers; but the most common way is to lay ['They', 'they', 'them', 'the oysters', 'they', 'they', 'They', 'they'] on mats of the seaweed which covers the banks. Thus ['They', 'they', 'them', 'the oysters', 'they', 'they', 'They', 'they'] die in the open air; and at the end of ten days ['They', 'they', 'them', 'the oysters', 'they', 'they', 'They', 'they'] are in a forward state of decomposition. ['They', 'they', 'them', 'the oysters', 'they', 'they', 'They', 'they'] are then plunged into large reservoirs of sea-water; then ['They', 'they', 'them', 'the oysters', 'they', 'they', 'They', 'they'] are opened and washed.” 
 
“The price of ['these pearls', 'their'] varies according to ['these pearls', 'their'] size?” asked Conseil. 
 
“Not only according to ['their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them'] size,” I answered, “but also according to ['their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them'] shape, ['their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them'] water (that is, ['their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them'] colour), and ['their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them'] lustre: that is, that bright and diapered sparkle which makes ['their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them'] so charming to the eye. ['The most beautiful', 'They', 'they'] are called virgin pearls, or paragons. ['The most beautiful', 'They', 'they'] are formed alone in the tissue of the mollusc, are white, often opaque, and sometimes have the transparency of an opal; ['The most beautiful', 'They', 'they'] are generally round or oval. The round are made into bracelets, the oval into pendants, and, being more precious, are sold singly. Those adhering to the shell of the oyster are more irregular in shape, and are sold by weight. Lastly, in a lower order are classed ['those small pearls known under the name of seed-pearls', 'they']; ['those small pearls known under the name of seed-pearls', 'they'] are sold by measure, and are especially used in embroidery for church ornaments.” 
 
“But,” said Conseil, “is this pearl-fishery dangerous?” 
 
“No,” I answered, quickly; “particularly if certain precautions are taken.” 
 
“What does one risk in such a calling?” said Ned Land, “the swallowing of some mouthfuls of sea-water?” 
 
“As you say, ['Ned', 'you', 'brave Ned']. By the bye,” said I, trying to take Captain Nemo’s careless tone, “are ['Ned', 'you', 'brave Ned'] afraid of sharks, ['Ned', 'you', 'brave Ned']?” 
 
“['I', 'the Canadian', 'my']!” replied ['I', 'the Canadian', 'my']; “a harpooner by profession? It is ['I', 'the Canadian', 'my'] trade to make light of them.” 
 
“But,” said I, “it is not a question of fishing for ['them', 'them', 'their', 'their'] with an iron-swivel, hoisting ['them', 'them', 'their', 'their'] into the vessel, cutting off ['them', 'them', 'their', 'th['their tails', 'them'] with a blow of a chopper, ripping ['their tails', 'them'] up, and throwing ['them', 'them', 'their', 'their'] heart into the sea!” 
 
“Then, it is a question of——” 
 
“Precisely.” 
 
“In the water?” 
 
“In the water.” 
 
“Faith, with a good harpoon! You know, ['sir', 'you'], ['these sharks', 'They', 'their'] are ill-fashioned beasts. ['these sharks', 'They', 'their'] turn on ['these sharks', 'They', 'their'] bellies to seize ['sir', 'you'], and in that time——” 
 
Ned Land had a way of saying “seize” which made my blood run cold. 
 
“Well, and ['you', 'you'], Conseil, what do ['you', 'you'] think of sharks?” 
 
“['Me', 'Conseil', 'I']!” said ['Me', 'Conseil', 'I']. “['Me', 'Conseil', 'I'] will be frank, sir.” 
 
“So much the better,” thought I. 
 
“If ['you', 'your', 'you'], sir, mean to face ['the sharks', 'them'], I do not see why ['you', 'your', 'you'] faithful servant should not face ['the sharks', 'them'] with ['you', 'your', 'you'].” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER III A PEARL OF TEN MILLIONS 
 
The next morning at four o’clock ['I', 'my', 'I'] was awakened by the steward whom Captain Nemo had placed at ['I', 'my', 'I'] service. ['I', 'my', 'I'] rose hurriedly, dressed, and went into the saloon. 
 
Captain Nemo was awaiting me. 
 
“['M. Aronnax', 'you'],” said he, “are ['M. Aronnax', 'you'] ready to start?” 
 
“I am ready.” 
 
“Then please to follow me.” 
 
“And my companions, Captain?” 
 
“They have been told and are waiting.” 
 
“Are ['we', 'our'] not to put on ['we', 'our'] diver’s dresses?” asked I. 
 
“Not yet. I have not allowed ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat', 'It'] to come too near this coast, and ['we', 'us', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] are some distance from the Manaar Bank; but ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat', 'It'] is ready, and will take ['we', 'us', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] to the exact point of disembarking, which will save ['we', 'us', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] a long way. ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat', 'It'] carries ['we', 'us', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] diving apparatus, which ['we', 'us', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] will put on when ['we', 'us', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] begin ['we', 'us', 'us', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our'] submarine journey.” 
 
Captain Nemo conducted me to the central staircase, which led on the platform. Ned and Conseil were already there, delighted at the idea of the “pleasure party” which was preparing. ['Five sailors from the _Nautilus_, with their oars'['Five sailors from the _Nautilus_, with their oars', 'their']eir'], waited in the boat, which had been made fast against the side. 
 
The night was still dark. Layers of clouds covered the sky, allowing but few stars to be seen. I looked on the side where the land lay, and saw nothing but a dark line enclosing three parts of the horizon, from south-west to north west. The _Nautilus_, having returned during the night up the western coast of Ceylon, was now west of the bay, or rather gulf, formed by the mainland and the Island of Manaar. There, under the dark waters, stretched the pintadine bank, an inexhaustible field of pearls, the length of which is more than twenty miles. 
 
['Captain Nemo, Ned Land, Conseil, and I', 'our', 'we'] took ['Captain Nemo, Ned Land, Conseil, and I', 'our', 'we'] places in the stern of the boat. ['The master', 'his'] went to the tiller; ['The master', 'hi['his four companions', 'their'] leaned on ['his four companions', 'their'] oars, the painter was cast off, and ['Captain Nemo, Ned Land, Conseil, and I', 'our', 'we'] sheered off. 
 
['The boat', 'the craft', 'its', 'the boat', 'it'] went towards the south; ['the oarsmen', 'their'] did not hurry. I noticed that ['the oarsmen', 'their'] strokes, strong in the water, only followed each other every ten seconds, according to the method generally adopted in the navy. Whilst ['The boat', 'the craft', 'its', 'the boat', 'it'] was running by ['The boat', 'the craft', 'its', 'the boat', 'it'] own velocity, the liquid drops struck the dark depths of the waves crisply like spats of melted lead. A little billow, spreading wide, gave a slight roll to ['The boat', 'the craft', 'its', 'the boat', 'it'], and some samphire reeds flapped before ['The boat', 'the craft', 'its', 'the boat', 'it']. 
 
We were silent. What was ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'him'] thinking of? Perhaps of ['the land he was a['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'him']roaching, and which he found['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'him']oo near to him, con['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'him']ry to the Canadian’s opinion, who thought it too f['the land he was approaching, and which he found too near to him, contrary to the Canadian’s opinion, who thought it too far off', 'it'] off', 'it']. As to ['Conseil', 'he'], ['Conseil', 'he'] was merely there from curiosity. 
 
About half-past five the first tints on the horizon showed ['the upper line of coast', 'it', 'it'] more distinctly. Flat enough in the east, ['the upper line of coast', 'it', 'it'] rose a little to the south. Five miles still lay between us, and ['the upper line of coast', 'it', 'it'] was indistinct owing to the mist on the water. At six o’clock it became suddenly daylight, with that rapidity peculiar to tropical regions, which know neither dawn nor twilight. The solar rays pierced the curtain of clouds, piled up on the eastern horizon, and the radiant orb rose rapidly. I saw land distinctly, with a few trees scattered here and there. The boat neared Manaar Island, which was rounded to the south. ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] rose from ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] seat and watched the sea. 
 
At a sign from him the anchor was dropped, but ['the chain', 'it'] scarcely ran, for ['the chain', 'it'] was little more than a yard deep, and this spot was one of the highest points of the bank of pintadines. 
 
“Here ['we', 'We', 'our', 'our'] are, ['M. Aronnax', 'You'],” said Captain Nemo. “['M. Aronnax', 'You'] see ['that enclosed bay', 'this bay', 'It']? Here, in a month will be assembled ['the numerous fishing boats of the exporters', 'their'], and these are the waters ['the numerous fishing boats of the exporters', 'their'] divers will ransack so boldly. Happily, ['that enclosed bay', 'this bay', 'It'] is well situated for that kind of fishing. ['that enclosed bay', 'this bay', 'It'] is sheltered from the strongest winds; ['the sea', 'it'] is never very rough here, which makes ['the sea', 'it'] favourable for the diver’s work. ['we', 'We', 'our', 'our'] will now put on ['we', 'We', 'our', 'our'] dresses, and begin ['we', 'We', 'our', 'our'] walk.” 
 
['I', 'my', 'my'] did not answer, and, while watching the suspected waves, began with the help of the sailors to put on ['I', 'my', 'my'] heavy sea-dress. Captain Nemo and ['I', 'my', 'my'] companions were also dressing. None of the _Nautilus_ men were to accompany us on this new excursion. 
 
Soon ['we', 'our'] were enveloped to the throat in india-rubber clothing; the air apparatus fixed to ['we', 'our'] backs by braces. As to ['the Ruhmkorff apparatus', 'it'], there was no necessity for ['the Ruhmkorff apparatus', 'it']. Before putting ['my', 'I'] head into the copper cap, ['my', 'I'] had asked the question of the Captain. 
 
“They would be useless,” he replied. “['We', 'our'] are going to no great depth, and the solar rays will be enough to light ['We', 'our'] walk. Besides, it would not be prudent to carry ['the electric light', 'its'] in these waters; ['the electric light', 'its'] brilliancy might attract some of the dangerous inhabitants of the coast most inopportunely.” 
 
As Captain Nemo pronounced these words, ['I', 'my'] turned to ['Conseil and Ned Land', 'my two friends', 'their', 'they']. But ['I', 'my['Conseil and Ned Land', 'my two friends', 'their', 'they'] had already encased ['Conseil and Ned Land', 'my two friends', 'their', 'they'] heads in the metal cap, and ['Conseil and Ned Land', 'my two friends', 'their', 'they'] could neither hear nor answer. 
 
One last question remained to ask of Captain Nemo. 
 
“And ['our', 'our'] arms?” asked I; “['our', 'our'] guns?” 
 
“Guns! What for? Do not ['mountaineers', 'their'] attack the bear with a dagger in ['mountaineers', 'their'] hand, and is not steel surer than lead? Here is ['a strong blade', 'it']; put ['a strong blade', 'it'] in your belt, and we start.” 
 
['I', 'my'] looked at ['I', 'my['my companions', 'they']; ['my companions', 'they'] were armed like us, and, more than that, ['Ned Land', 'he'] was brandishing an enormous harpoon, which ['Ned Land', 'he'] had placed in the boat before leaving the _Nautilus_. 
 
Then, following ['the Captain’s', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him'] example, ['I', 'myself'] allowed ['I', 'myself'] to be dressed in the heavy copper helmet, and ['our', 'we', 'we', 'we'] reservoirs of air were at once in activity. An instant after ['our', 'we', 'we', 'we'] were landed, one after the other, in about two yards of water upon an even sand. ['the Captain’s', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him'] made a sign with ['the Captain’s', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him'] hand, and ['our', 'we', 'we', 'we'] followed ['the Captain’s', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him'] by a gentle declivity till ['our', 'we', 'we', 'we'] disappeared under the waves. 
 
Over our feet, like coveys of snipe in a bog, ['rose shoals of fish, of the genus monoptera, which have no other fins but their tail'['rose shoals of fish, of the genus monoptera, which have no other fins but their tail', 'their']eir']. ['I', 'I'] recognized the Javanese, a real serpent two and a half feet long, of a livid colour underneath, and which might easily be mistaken for a conger eel if it were not for the golden stripes on its side. In the genus stromateus, whose bodies are very flat and oval, ['I', 'I'] saw ['some of the most brilliant colours', 'their'], carrying ['some of the most brilliant colours', 'their'] dorsal fin like a scythe; an excellent eating fish, which, dried and pickled, is known by the name of Karawade; then some tranquebars, belonging to the genus apsiphoroides, whose body is covered with a shell cuirass of eight longitudinal plates. 
 
The heightening sun lit the mass of waters more and more. The soil changed by degrees. To the fine sand succeeded a perfect causeway of boulders, covered with a carpet of molluscs and zoophytes. Amongst the specimens of these branches I noticed some placenae, with thin unequal shells, a kind of ostracion peculiar to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean; some orange lucinae with rounded shells; ['rockfish three feet and a half long, which raised themselves under['rockfish three feet and a half long, which raised themselves under the waves like hands ready to seize one', 'themselves'] like hands ready to seize one', 'themselves']. There were also some panopyres, slightly luminous; and lastly, some oculines, like magnificent fans, forming one of the richest vegetations of these seas. 
 
In the midst of these living plants, and under the arbours of the hydrophytes, were layers of clumsy articulates, particularly some raninae, whose carapace formed a slightly rounded triangle; and some horrible looking parthenopes. 
 
At about seven o’clock ['we', 'ourselves'] found ['we', 'ourselves'] at last surveying the oyster-banks on which the pearl-oysters are reproduced by millions. 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain, who seemed to guide him self by paths known only to himself', 'him self', 'himself'] ['pointed', 'this mine'] with ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain, who seemed to guide him self by paths known only to himself', 'him self', 'himself'] hand to the enormous heap of oysters; and ['I', 'my'] could well understand that ['pointed', 'this mine'] was inexhaustible, for Nature’s creative power is far beyond man’s instinct of destruction. ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'his'], faithful to ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'his'] instinct, hastened to fill a net which ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'his'] carried by ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'his'] side with some of the finest specimens. But ['we', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'our'] could not stop. ['we', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'our'] must follow ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain, who seemed to guide him self by paths known o['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain, who seemed to guide him self by paths known only to himself', 'him self', 'himself']imself', 'him self', 'hi['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Captain, who seemed to guide him self by paths known only to himself', 'him self', 'himself']. The ground was sensibly rising, and sometimes, on holding up ['I', 'my['my arm', 'it'], ['my arm', 'it'] was above the surface of the sea. Then the level of the bank would sink capriciously. Often ['we', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'our'] rounded ['high rocks scarped into pyramids', 'their']. In ['high rocks scarped into pyramids', 'their'] dark fractures ['huge crustacea', 'their'], perched upon ['huge crustacea', 'their'] high claws like some war-machine, watched ['we', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'our'] with fixed eyes, and under ['we', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'our'] feet crawled various kinds of annelides. 
 
At this moment there opened before ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] ['a large grotto dug in a picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the submarine flora', 'it', 'its', 'the grotto']. At first ['a large grotto dug in a picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the submarine flora', 'it', 'its', 'the grotto'] seemed very dark to ['me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']. The solar rays seemed to be extinguished by successive gradations, until ['a large grotto dug in a picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the submarine flora', 'it', 'its', 'the grotto'] vague transparency became nothing more than drowned light. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] entered; ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] followed. ['me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I['My eyes', 'themselves'] soon accustomed ['My eyes', 'themselves'] to this relative state of darkness. ['me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could distinguish ['the arches springing capriciously', 'their'] from natural pillars, standing broad upon ['the arches springing capriciously', 'their'] granite base, like the heavy columns of Tuscan architecture. Why had ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] incomprehensible guide led ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] to the bottom of this submarine crypt? ['me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was soon to know. After descending a rather sharp declivity, ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our'] feet trod the bottom of a kind of circular pit. There ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] stopped, and with ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] hand indicated ['an object I had not yet perceived', 'It', 'this extraordinary mollusc', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'it['me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']elf', 'this tridacne']. ['an object I had not yet perceived', 'It', 'this extraordinary mollusc', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'this tridacne'] was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a gigantic tridacne, a goblet which could have contained a whole lake of holy-water, a basin the breadth of which was more than two yards and a half, and consequently larger than that ornamenting the saloon of the _Nautilus_. ['me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] approached ['an object I had not yet perceived', 'It', 'this extraordinary mollusc', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'this tridacne']. ['an object I had not yet perceived', 'It', 'this extraordinary mollusc', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'this tridacne'] adhered by ['an object I had not yet perceived', 'It', 'this extraordinary mollusc', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'this tridacne'] filaments to a table of granite, and there, isolated, ['an object I had not yet perceived', 'It', 'this extraordinary mollusc', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'this tridacne'] developed ['an object I had not yet perceived', 'It', 'this extraordinary mollusc', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'this tridacne'] in the calm waters of ['a large grotto dug in a picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the submarine flora', 'it', 'its', 'the grotto']. ['me', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] estimated the weight of ['an object I had not yet perceived', 'It', 'this extraordinary mollusc', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'this tridacne'] at 600 lbs. Such an oyster would contain 30 lbs. of meat; and one must have the stomach of a Gargantua to demolish some dozens of them. 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he'] was evidently acquainted with the existence of ['this bivalve', 'this tridacne', 'the creature', 'the tridacne'], and seemed to have a particular motive in verifying the actual state of ['this bivalve', 'this tridacne', 'the creature', 'the tridacne']. ['The shells', 'them', 'the two shells'] were a little open; ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he'] came near and put ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'h['his dagger', 'his dagger'] between to prevent ['The shells', 'them', 'the two shells'] from closing; then with ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he'] hand ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he'] raised ['the membrane with its fring['the membrane with its fringed edges, which formed a cloak for the creature', 'its']edges, which formed a cloak for the creat['this bivalve', 'this tridacne', 'the creature', 'the tridacne']. There, between the folded plaits, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I'] saw ['a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut', 'Its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this pearl', 'it', 'its']. ['a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut', 'Its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this pearl', 'it', 'its'] globular shape, perfect clearness, and admirable lustre made ['a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut', 'Its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this pearl', 'it', 'its'] altogether a jewel of inestimable value. Carried away by ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I'] curiosity, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I'] stretched out ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I'] hand to seize ['a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut', 'Its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this pearl', 'it', 'its'], weigh ['a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut', 'Its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this pearl', 'it', 'its'], and touch ['a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut', 'Its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this pearl', 'it', 'its']; but ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he'] stopped ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I'], made a sign of refusal, and quickly withdrew ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'h['his dagger', 'his dagger'], and ['The shells', 'them', 'the two shells'] closed suddenly. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I'] then understood ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he'] intention. In leaving ['a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut', 'Its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this pearl', 'it', 'its'] hidden in the mantle of ['this bivalve', 'this tridacne', 'the creature', 'the tridacne'] ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he'] was allowing ['a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut', 'Its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this pearl', 'it', 'its'] to grow slowly. Each year the secretions of the mollusc would add new concentric circles. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I'] estimated ['a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut', 'Its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'this pearl', 'it', 'its'] value at £500,000 at least. 
 
After ten minutes ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'him', 'his'] stopped suddenly. ['I', 'I'] thought ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'him', 'his'] had halted previously to returning. No; by a gesture ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'him', 'his'] bade us crouch beside ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'him', 'his'] in a deep fracture of the rock, ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'him', 'his'] hand pointed to one part of the liquid mass, which ['I', 'I'] watched attentively. 
 
About five yards from ['me', 'my', 'I'] ['a shadow', 'it'] appeared, and sank to the ground. The disquieting idea of sharks shot through ['me', 'my', 'I'] mind, but ['me', 'my', 'I'] was mistaken; and once again ['a shadow', 'it'] was not a monster of the ocean that we had anything to do with. 
 
It was ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his',['I', 'I']'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his']. ['I', 'I'] could see the bottom of ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his'] canoe anchored some feet above ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his'] head. ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his'] dived and went up successively. ['A stone held between his feet, cut i['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his']he shape of a sugar loaf', 'his stone'], whilst a rope fastened ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his'] to ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his'] boat, helped ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his'] to descend more rapidly. This was all ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his'] apparatus. Reaching the bottom, about five yards deep, ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his'] went on ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his'] knees and filled ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'hi['his bag', 'it'] with oysters picked up at random. Then ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'his'] went up, emptied ['his bag', 'it'], pulled up ['a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I suppose, had come to glean before the harvest', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'his', 'he', 'hi['A stone held between his feet, cut in the shape of a sugar loaf', 'his stone'], and began the operation once more, which lasted thirty seconds. 
 
['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him'] did not see ['us', 'us']. The shadow of the rock hid ['us', 'us'] from sight. And how should ['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him'] ever dream that men, beings like ['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him'], should be there under the water watching ['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him'] movements and losing no detail of the fishing? Several times ['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him'] went up in this way, and dived again. ['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him'] did not carry away ['more than ten', 'them', 'they', 'their'] at each plunge, for ['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him'] was obliged to pull ['more than ten', 'them', 'they', 'their'] from the bank to which ['more than ten', 'them', 'they', 'their'] adhered by means of ['more than ten', 'them', 'they', 'their'] strong byssus. And how many of ['those oysters for which he risked ['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him']s life',['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him']hem'] had no pearl in ['those oysters for which he risked his life', 'them']! I watched ['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him'] closely; ['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him'] manœuvres were regular; and for the space of half an hour no danger appeared to threaten ['The diver', 'this poor Indian', 'himself', 'his', 'he', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him']. 
 
['I', 'myself', 'I'] was beginning to accustom ['I', 'myself', 'I'] to the sight of this interesting fishing, when suddenly, as ['the Indian', 'him'] was on the ground, ['I', 'myself', 'I'] saw ['the Indian', 'him'] make a gesture of terror, rise, and make a spring to return to the surface of the sea. 
 
['I', 'I'] understood his dread. ['A gigantic shadow', 'It', 'his', 'his'] appeared just above the unfortunate diver. ['A gigantic shadow', 'It', 'his', 'his'] was a shark of enormous size advancing diagonally, ['A gigantic shadow', 'It', 'his', 'his'] eyes on fire, and ['A gigantic shadow', 'It', 'his', 'his'] jaws open. ['I', 'I'] was mute with horror and unable to move. 
 
['The voracious creature', 'the shark’s', 'its', 'it'] shot towards ['the Indian, who threw himself on one side to avoi['the Indian, who threw himself on one side to avoid the shark’s fins', 'himself', 'his', 'him']hark’s fins', 'himself['The voracious creature', 'the shark’s', 'its', 'it']him']; but not ['The voracious creature', 'the shark’s', 'its', 'it'] tail, for ['The voracious creature', 'the shark’s', 'its', 'it'] struck ['the Indian, who threw himself on one side to avoid the shark’s fins', 'himself', 'his', 'him'] chest and stretched ['the Indian, who threw himself on one side to avoid the shark’s fins', 'himself', 'his', 'him'] on the ground. 
 
This scene lasted but a few seconds: ['the shark', 'his', 'himself', 'the monster', 'him', 'the shark', 'his new adversary', 'him'] returned, and, turning on ['the shark', 'his', 'himself', 'the monster', 'him', 'the shark', 'his new adversary', 'him'] back, prepared ['the shark', 'his', 'himself', 'the monster', 'him', 'the shark', 'his new adversary', 'him'] for cutting the Indian in two, when I saw ['Captain Nemo', 'the unhappy fisherman', 'he', 'his'] rise suddenly, and then, dagger in hand, walk straight to ['the shark', 'his', 'himself', 'the monster', 'him', 'the shark', 'his new adversary', 'him'], ready to fight face to face with ['the shark', 'his', 'himself', 'the monster', 'him', 'the shark', 'his new adversary', 'him']. The very moment ['the shark', 'his', 'himself', 'the monster', 'him', 'the shark', 'his new adversary', 'him'] was going to snap ['Captain Nemo', 'the unhappy fisherman', 'he', 'his'] in two, ['Captain Nemo', 'the unhappy fisherman', 'he', 'his'] perceived ['the shark', 'his', 'himself', 'the monster', 'him', 'the shark', 'his new a['Captain Nemo', 'the unhappy fisherman', 'he', 'his']rsary', 'him'], and, turning over, made straight towards ['the shark', 'his', 'himself', 'the monster', 'him', 'the shark', 'his new adversary', 'him']. 
 
I can still see ['Captain Nemo’s', 'himself', 'he', 'him', 'himself', 'his'] position. Holding ['Captain Nemo’s', 'himself', 'he', 'him', 'himself', 'his'] well together, ['Captain Nemo’s', 'himself', 'he', 'him', 'himself', 'his'] waited for ['the shark', 'it', 'its'] with admirable coolness; and, when ['the shark', 'it', 'its'] rushed at ['Captain Nemo’s', 'himself', 'he', 'him', 'himself', 'his'], threw ['Captain Nemo’s', 'himself', 'he', 'him', 'himself', 'his'] on ['one side', 'its side'] with wonderful quickness, avoiding the shock, and burying ['Captain Nemo’s', 'himself', 'he', 'him', 'himself', 'his'] dagger deep into ['the shark', 'it', 'it['one side', 'its side']. But it was not all over. A terrible combat ensued. 
 
[Illustration] A terrible combat began 
 
['The shark', 'its', 'the creature’s', 'the monster', 'his enemy'] had seemed to roar, if ['I', 'I', 'I'] might say so. The blood rushed in torrents from ['The shark', 'its', 'the creature’s', 'the monster', 'his enemy'] wound. The sea was dyed red, and through the opaque liquid ['I', 'I', 'I'] could distinguish nothing more. Nothing more until the moment when, like lightning, ['I', 'I', 'I'] saw ['the undaunted Captain', 'his'] hanging on to one of ['The shark', 'its', 'the creature’s', 'the monster', 'his enemy'] fins, struggling, as it were, hand to hand with ['The shark', 'its', 'the creature’s', 'the monster', 'his enemy'], and dealing successive blows at ['The shark', 'its', 'the creature’s', 'the monster', 'hi['the undaunted Captain', 'his']nemy'], yet still unable to give a decisive one. 
 
The shark’s struggles agitated the water with such fury that the rocking threatened to upset me. 
 
['I', 'I'] wanted to go to the Captain’s assistance, but, nailed to the spot with horror, ['I', 'I'] could not stir. 
 
['I', 'I'] saw the haggard eye; ['I', 'I'] saw the different phases of the fight. ['The Captain', 'him', 'the Captain'] fell to the earth, upset by ['the enormous mass which leant upon him', 'The shark’s', 'the shark', 'it', 'it['The Captain', 'him', 'the Captain']. ['the enormous mass which leant upon him', 'The shark’s', 'the shark', 'it', 'its'] jaws opened wide, like a pair of factory shears, and it would have been all over with ['The Captain', 'him', 'the Captain']; but, quick as thought, harpoon in hand, Ned Land rushed towards ['the enormous mass which leant upon him', 'The shark’s', 'the shark', 'it', 'its'] and struck ['the enormous mass which leant upon him', 'The shark’s', 'the shark', 'it', 'its'] with ['the enormous mass which leant upon him', 'The shark’s', 'the shark', 'it', 'its'] sharp point. 
 
['The waves', 'They', 'them'] were impregnated with a mass of blood. ['The waves', 'They', 'them'] rocked under ['the shark’s', 'the monster’s', 'it'] movements, which beat ['The waves', 'They', 'them'] with indescribable fury. ['Ned Land', 'his'] had not missed ['Ned Land', 'his'] aim. It was ['the shark’s', 'the monster’s', 'it'] death-rattle. Struck to the heart, ['the shark’s', 'the monster’s', 'it'] struggled in dreadful convulsions, the shock of which overthrew Conseil. 
 
But Ned Land had disentangled the Captain, who, getting up without any wound, went straight to the Indian, quickly cut the cord which held ['him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'his'] to ['him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'his'] stone, took ['him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'his'] in ['him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'his'] arms, and, with a sharp blow of ['him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'his'] heel, mounted to the surface. 
 
We all three followed in a few seconds, saved by a miracle, and reached the fisherman’s boat. 
 
['Captain Nemo’s', 'he'] first care was to recall ['the unfortunate man', 'the poor creature’s', 'his'] to life again. ['I', 'I'] did not think ['Captain Nemo’s', 'he'] could succeed. ['I', 'I'] hoped so, for ['the unfortunate man', 'the poor creature’s', 'his'] immersion was not long; but the blow from the shark’s tail might have been ['the unfortunate man', 'the poor creature’s', 'his'] death-blow. 
 
Happily, with the Captain’s and Conseil’s sharp friction, ['I', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'he'] saw consciousness return by degrees. ['I', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'he'] opened ['I', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'h['his eyes', 'His wondering eyes']. What was ['I', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'he'] surprise, ['I', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'he'] terror even, at seeing four great copper heads leaning over ['I', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'he']! And, above all, what must ['I', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'he'] have thought when ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'the man of the waters'], drawing from the pocket of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'the man of the waters'] dress ['a bag of pearls', 'it', 'This munificent charity from the man of the waters to the poor Cingalese'], placed ['a bag of pearls', 'it', 'This munificent charity from the man of the waters to the poor Cingalese'] in ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'the man of the waters'] hand! ['a bag of pearls', 'it', 'This munificent charity from th['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his', 'the man of the waters']o the poor Cingalese'] was accepted with a trembling hand. ['I', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'h['his eyes', 'His wondering eyes'] showed that ['I', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'he'] knew not to what super-human beings ['I', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'he', 'he'] owed both fortune and life. 
 
At a sign from the Captain we regained the bank, and, following the road already traversed, came in about half an hour to the anchor which held the canoe of the _Nautilus_ to the earth. 
 
Once on board, we each, with the help of the sailors, got rid of the heavy copper helmet. 
 
Captain Nemo’s first word was to the Canadian. 
 
“Thank ['you', 'Master Land'], ['you', 'Master Land'],” said he. 
 
“['It', 'that'] was in revenge, ['Captain', 'you'],” replied ['Ned Land', 'I']. “['Ned Land', 'I'] owed ['Captain', 'you'] ['It', 'that'].” 
 
A ghastly smile passed across the Captain’s lips, and that was all. 
 
“To the _Nautilus_,” said he. 
 
The boat flew over the waves. Some minutes after we met ['the shark’s', 'its', 'the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the species of shark so properly called', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It'] dead body floating. By the black marking of the extremity of ['the shark’s', 'its', 'the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the species of shark so properly called', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It'] fins, I recognised ['the shark’s', 'its', 'the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the species of shark so properly called', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It']. ['the shark’s', 'its', 'the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the species of shark so properly called', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It'] was more than twenty-five feet long; ['the shark’s', 'its', 'the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the species of shark so properly called', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It'] enormous mouth occupied one-third of ['the shark’s', 'its', 'the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the species of shark so properly called', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It'] body. ['the shark’s', 'its', 'the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the species of shark so properly called', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'It'] was an adult, as was known by its six rows of teeth placed in an isosceles triangle in the upper jaw. 
 
Whilst I was contemplating ['this inert mass', 'the dead body'], ['a dozen of these voracious beasts', 'themselves'] appeared round the boat; and, without noticing us, threw ['a dozen of these voracious beasts', 'themselves'] upon ['this inert mass', 'the dead body'] and fought with one another for the pieces. 
 
At half-past eight ['we', 'our'] were again on board the _Nautilus_. There I reflected on the incidents which had taken place in ['we', 'our'] excursion to the Manaar Bank. 
 
Two conclusions I must inevitably draw from it—one bearing upon the unparalleled courage of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'his'], the other upon ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'his'] devotion to a human being, a representative of that race from which ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'his'] fled beneath the sea. Whatever ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'his'] might say, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'his'] had not yet succeeded in entirely crushing ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'his'] heart. 
 
When I made this observation to ['him', 'he'], ['him', 'he'] answered in a slightly moved tone: 
 
“That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of ['an oppressed country', 'them']; and ['I', 'my'] am still, and shall be, to ['I', 'my'] last breath, one of ['an oppressed country', 'them']!” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER IV THE RED SEA 
 
In the course of the day of the 29th of January, the island of Ceylon disappeared under the horizon, and ['the _Nautilus_', 'It'], at a speed of twenty miles an hour, slid into the labyrinth of canals which separate the Maldives from ['the Laccadives', 'the Laccadive Archipelago']. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It'] coasted even the Island of Kiltan, a land originally coraline, discovered by Vasco da Gama in 1499, and one of the nineteen principal islands of ['the Laccadives', 'the Laccadive Archipelago'], situated between 10° and 14° 30′ N. lat., and 69° 50′ 72″ E. long. 
 
['We', 'our'] had made 16,220 miles, or 7,500 (French) leagues from ['We', 'our'] starting-point in the Japanese Seas. 
 
The next day (30th January), when ['the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'It'] went to the surface of the ocean there was no land in sight. ['the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'It'] course was N.N.E., in the direction of the Sea of Oman, between Arabia and the Indian Peninsula, which serves as an outlet to the Persian Gulf. ['the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'It'] was evidently a block without any possible egress. Where was Captain Nemo taking ['us', 'we'] to? ['I', 'me'] could not say. This, however, did not satisfy the Canadian, who that day came to ['I', 'me'] asking where ['us', 'we'] were going. 
 
“['We', 'our', 'us'] are going where ['We', 'our', 'us'] Captain’s fancy takes ['We', 'our', 'us'], Master Ned.” 
 
“His fancy cannot take ['us', 'we', 'we'] far, then,” said the Canadian. “The Persian Gulf has no outlet: and, if ['us', 'we', 'we'] do go in, it will not be long before ['us', 'we', 'we'] are out again.” 
 
“Very well, then, ['we', 'us'] will come out again, Master Land; and if, after the Persian Gulf, the _Nautilus_ would like to visit the Red Sea, the Straits of Bab-el-mandeb are there to give ['we', 'us'] entrance.” 
 
“['I', 'Ned Land'] need not tell ['you', 'sir'], ['you', 'sir'],” said ['I', 'Ned Land'], “that ['the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea'] is as much closed as the Gulf, as the Isthmus of Suez is not yet cut; and, if it was, ['a boat as mysterious as ours', 'itse['ours', 'us'] would not risk ['a boat as mysterious as ours', 'itself'] in a canal cut with sluices. And again, ['the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea'] is not the road to take ['ours', 'us'] back to Europe.” 
 
“But I never said we were going back to Europe.” 
 
“What do you suppose, then?” 
 
“I suppose that, after visiting the curious coasts of Arabia and Egypt, the _Nautilus_ will go down the Indian Ocean again, perhaps cross the Channel of Mozambique, perhaps off the Mascarenhas, so as to gain the Cape of Good Hope.” 
 
“And once at the Cape of Good Hope?” asked the Canadian, with peculiar emphasis. 
 
“Well, ['we', 'we'] shall penetrate into that Atlantic which ['we', 'we'] do not yet know. Ah! ['friend Ned', 'you', 'you'], ['friend Ned', 'you', 'you'] are getting tired of this journey under the sea; ['friend Ned', 'you', 'you'] are surfeited with the incessantly varying spectacle of submarine wonders. For ['my', 'I'] part, ['my', 'I'] shall be sorry to see the end of a voyage which it is given to so few men to make.” 
 
For four days, till the 3rd of February, ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'it'] scoured the Sea of Oman, at various speeds and at various depths. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'it'] seemed to go at random, as if hesitating as to which road ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'it'] should follow, but we never passed the Tropic of Cancer. 
 
In quitting ['this sea', 'the sea'] we sighted ['Muscat', 'one of the most important towns of the country of ['Muscat for an instant, one of the most important towns of th['Muscat', 'one of the most important towns of the country of Oman']. ['I', 'I'] admired ['Muscat for an instant, one of the most important towns of the country of Oman', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] strange aspect, surrounded by black rocks upon which ['Muscat for an instant, one of the most important towns of the country of Oman', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] white houses and forts stood in relief. ['I', 'I'] saw the rounded domes of ['Muscat for an instant, one of the most important towns of the country of Oman', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] mosques, the elegant points of ['Muscat for an instant, one of the most important towns of the country of Oman', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] minarets, ['Muscat for an instant, one of the most important towns of the country of Oman', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] fresh and verdant terraces. But it was only a vision! The _Nautilus_ soon sank under the waves of that part of ['this sea', 'the sea']. 
 
['We', 'we'] passed along ['the Arabian coast of Mahrah and Hadramaut', 'its'], for a distance of six miles, ['the Arabian coast of Mahrah and Hadramaut', 'its'] undulating line of mountains being occasionally relieved by some ancient ruin. The 5th of February ['We', 'we'] at last entered the Gulf of Aden, a perfect funnel introduced into the neck of Bab-el-mandeb, through which the Indian waters entered the Red Sea. 
 
The 6th of February, the _Nautilus_ floated in sight of ['Aden', 'this town, which was at one time the richest commercial magazine on the coast'], perched upon a promontory which a narrow isthmus joins to the mainland, a kind of inaccessible Gibraltar, the fortifications of which were rebuilt by the English after taking possession in 1839. I caught a glimpse of the octagon minarets of ['Aden', 'this town, which was at one time the richest commercial magazine on the coast']. 
 
['I', 'I', 'my'] certainly thought that ['Captain Nemo', 'he'], arrived at this point, would back out again; but ['I', 'I', 'my'] was mistaken, for ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] did no such thing, much to ['I', 'I', 'my'] surprise. 
 
The next day, the 7th of February, we entered the Straits of Bab-el-mandeb, the name of which, in the Arab tongue, means The Gate of Tears. 
 
To twenty miles in breadth, ['it', 'this narrow passage'] is only thirty-two in length. And for ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'it'], starting at full speed, the crossing was scarcely the work of an hour. But I saw nothing, not even the Island of Perim, with which the British Government has fortified the position of Aden. There were too many English or French steamers of the line of Suez to Bombay, Calcutta to Melbourne, and from Bourbon to the Mauritius, furrowing ['it', 'this narrow passage'], for ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'it'] to venture to show ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'it']. So ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'it'] remained prudently below. At last about noon, we were in the waters of the Red Sea. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I'] would not even seek to understand the caprice which had decided Captain Nemo upon entering ['the gulf', 'it', 'this curious sea']. But ['I', 'I', 'I'] quite approved of ['the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'it', 'it'] entering ['the gulf', 'it', 'this curious sea']. ['the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'it', 'it'] speed was lessened: sometimes ['the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'it', 'it'] kept on the surface, sometimes ['the _Nautilus_', 'Its', 'it', 'it'] dived to avoid a vessel, and thus ['I', 'I', 'I'] was able to observe the upper and lower parts of ['the gulf', 'it', 'this curious sea']. 
 
The 8th of February, from the first dawn of day, Mocha came in sight, now a ruined town, whose walls would fall at a gunshot, yet which shelters here and there some verdant date-trees; once an important city, containing six public markets, and twenty-six mosques, and whose walls, defended by fourteen forts, formed a girdle of two miles in circumference. 
 
['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] then approached the African shore, where the depth of ['the sea', 'the sea'] was greater. There, between two waters clear as crystal, through the open panels we were allowed to contemplate ['the beautiful bushes of brilliant coral', 'these shrubs', 'their', 'this display of zoophytes', 'they'] and large blocks of rock clothed with a splendid fur of green variety of sites and landscapes along these sandbanks and algæ and fuci. What an indescribable spectacle, and what variety of sites and landscapes along these sandbanks and volcanic islands which bound the Libyan coast! But where ['the beautiful bushes of brilliant coral', 'these shrubs', 'their', 'this display of zoophytes', 'they'] appeared in all ['the beautiful bushes of brilliant coral', 'these shrubs', 'their', 'this display of zoophytes', 'they'] beauty was on ['the eastern coast, which the _Nau['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_']ined', 'It']. ['the eastern coast, which the _Nautilus_ soon gained', 'It'] was on the coast of Tehama, for there not only did ['the beautiful bushes of brilliant coral', 'these shrubs', 'their', 'this display of zoophytes', 'they'] flourish beneath the level of ['the sea', 'the sea'], but ['the beautiful bushes of brilliant coral', 'these shrubs', 'their', 'this display of zoophytes', 'they'] also formed picturesque interlacings which unfolded themselves about sixty feet above the surface, more capricious but less highly coloured than those whose freshness was kept up by the vital power of the waters. 
 
What charming hours ['I', 'I'] passed thus at the window of the saloon! What new specimens of submarine flora and fauna did ['I', 'I'] admire under the brightness of our electric lantern! 
 
The 9th of February the _Nautilus_ floated in the broadest part of the Red Sea, which is comprised between Souakin, on the west coast, and Komfidah, on the east coast, with a diameter of ninety miles. 
 
That day at noon, after the bearings were taken, ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'he'] mounted the platform, where ['I', 'I', 'me', 'me'] happened to be, and ['I', 'I', 'me', 'me'] was determined not to let ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'he'] go down again without at least pressing ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'he'] regarding ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'he'] ulterior projects. As soon as ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'he'] saw ['I', 'I', 'me', 'me'] ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'he'] approached and graciously offered ['I', 'I', 'me', 'me'] a cigar. 
 
“Well, ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'you'], does ['this Red Sea', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] please ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'you']? Have ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'you'] sufficiently observed the wonders ['this Red Sea', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] covers, ['this Red Sea', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] fishes, ['this Red Sea', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] zoophytes, ['this Red Sea', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] parterres of sponges, and ['this Red Sea', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] forests of coral? Did ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'you'] catch a glimpse of the towns on ['this Red Sea', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] borders?” 
 
“Yes, Captain Nemo,” I replied; “and ['the _Nautilus', 'it']_ is wonderfully fitted for such a study. Ah! ['the _Nautilus', 'it'] is an intelligent boat!” 
 
“Yes, sir, intelligent and invulnerable. It fears neither the terrible tempests of ['the Red Sea', 'its', 'its'], nor ['the Red Sea', 'its', 'its'] currents, nor ['the Red Sea', 'its', 'its'] sandbanks.” 
 
“Certainly,” said ['I', 'I'], “['this sea', 'its'] is quoted as one of the worst, and in the time of the ancients, if ['I', 'I'] am not mistaken, ['this sea', 'its'] reputation was detestable.” 
 
“Detestable, M. Aronnax. The Greek and Latin historians do not speak favourably of ['it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its'], and Strabo says ['it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its'] is very dangerous during the Etesian winds and in the rainy season. ['The Arabian Edrisi', 'he'] portrays ['it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its'] under the name of the Gulf of Colzoum, and relates that vessels perished there in great numbers on the sandbanks and that no one would risk sailing in the night. ['it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its'] is, ['The Arabian Edrisi', 'he'] pretends, a sea subject to fearful hurricanes, strewn with inhospitable islands, and ‘which offers nothing good either on ['it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its'] surface or in ['it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'its'] depths.’” 
 
“One may see,” I replied, “that these historians never sailed on board the _Nautilus_.” 
 
“Just so,” replied the Captain, smiling; “and in that respect moderns are not more advanced than the ancients. It required many ages to find out the mechanical power of steam. Who knows if, in another hundred years, we may not see a second _Nautilus?_ Progress is slow, M. Aronnax.” 
 
“It is true,” ['I', 'your'] answered; “['I', 'yo['your boat', 'its'] is at least a century before ['your boat', 'its'] time, perhaps an era. What a misfortune that the secret of ['such an invention', 'its'] should die with ['such an invention', 'its'] inventor!” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'he'] did not reply. After some minutes’ silence ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] continued: 
 
“You were speaking of the opinions of ancient historians upon the dangerous navigation of the Red Sea.” 
 
“It is true,” said I; “but were not their fears exaggerated?” 
 
“Yes and no, M. Aronnax,” replied Captain Nemo, who seemed to know ['the Red Sea', 'this gulf'] by heart. “['That which is no longer dangerous for a modern vessel, well rigged, strongly built, and master of its own c['That which is no longer dangerous for a modern vessel, well rigged, strongly built, and master of its own course, thanks to obedient steam', 'its']se, thanks to obedient steam', 'its'], offered all sorts of perils to the ships of the ancients. Picture to yourself ['those first navigators', 'They', 'their', 'they', 'they'] venturing in ships made of planks sewn with the cords of the palmtree, saturated with the grease of the seadog, and covered with powdered resin! ['those first navigators', 'They', 'their', 'they', 'they'] had not even instruments wherewith to take ['those first navigators', 'They', 'their', 'they', 'they'] bearings, and ['those first navigators', 'They', 'their', 'they', 'they'] went by guess amongst currents of which ['those first navigators', 'They', 'their', 'they', 'they'] scarcely knew anything. Under such conditions shipwrecks were, and must have been, numerous. But in our time, steamers running between Suez and the South Seas have nothing more to fear from the fury of ['the Red Sea', 'this gulf'], in spite of contrary trade-winds. ['The captain and passengers', 'their', 'their', 'they'] do not prepare for ['The captain and passengers', 'their', 'their', 'they'] departure by offering propitiatory sacrifices; and, on ['The captain and passengers', 'their', 'their', 'they'] return, ['The captain and passengers', 'their', 'their', 'they'] no longer go ornamented with wreaths and gilt fillets to thank the gods in the neighbouring temple.” 
 
“['I', 'I', 'me'] agree with ['you', 'Captain', 'you', 'you'],” said ['I', 'I', 'me']; “and steam seems to have killed all gratitude in the hearts of sailors. But, ['you', 'Captain', 'you', 'you'], since ['you', 'Captain', 'you', 'you'] seem to have especially studied ['this sea', 'its'], can ['you', 'Captain', 'you', 'you'] tell ['I', 'I', 'me'] the origin of ['this sea', 'its'] name?” 
 
“There exist several explanations on the subject, M. Aronnax. Would you like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century?” 
 
“Willingly.” 
 
“This fanciful writer pretends that ['its', 'it'] name was given to ['its', 'it'] after the passage of the Israelites, when Pharaoh perished in the waves which closed at the voice of Moses.” 
 
“['A poet’s explanation', 'that'], ['Captain Nemo', 'you', 'your'],” ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] replied; “but ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] cannot content ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] with ['A poet’s explanation', 'that']. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] ask ['Captain Nemo', 'you', 'your'] for ['Captain Nemo', 'you', 'your'] personal opinion.” 
 
“Here it is, M. Aronnax. According to my idea, we must see in this appellation of ['the Red Sea', 'it', 'its'] a translation of the Hebrew word ‘Edom’; and if the ancients ['gave', 'it'] ['the Red Sea', 'it', 'its'] that name, ['gave', 'it'] was on account of the particular colour of ['the Red Sea', 'it', 'its'] waters.” 
 
“But up to this time I have seen nothing but transparent waves and without any particular colour.” 
 
“Very likely; but as we advance to the bottom of the gulf, you will see this singular appearance. I remember seeing the Bay of Tor entirely red, like a sea of blood.” 
 
“And you attribute this colour to the presence of a microscopic seaweed?” 
 
“Yes.” 
 
“So, ['Captain Nemo', 'you'], it is not the first time ['Captain Nemo', 'you'] have overrun the Red Sea on board the _Nautilus?_” 
 
“No, sir.” 
 
“As ['you', 'you'] spoke a while ago of ['the passage of the Israelites and of the catastrophe to the Egyptians', 'this great historical fact'], I will ask whether ['you', 'you'] have met with the traces under the water of ['the passage of the Israelites and of the catastrophe to the Egyptians', 'this great historical fact']?” 
 
“No, sir; and for a good reason.” 
 
“What is it?” 
 
“It is that the spot where ['Moses', 'his'] and ['Moses', 'his'] people passed is now so blocked up with sand that ['the camels', 'their'] can barely bathe ['the camels', 'their'] legs there. You can well understand that there would not be water enough for my _Nautilus_.” 
 
“And the spot?” I asked. 
 
“['The spot', 'that spot'] is situated a little above the Isthmus of Suez, in the arm which formerly made a deep estuary, when the Red Sea extended to the Salt Lakes. Now, whether this passage were miraculous or not, the Israelites, nevertheless, crossed there to reach the Promised Land, and Pharaoh’s army perished precisely on ['The spot', 'that spot']; and I think that excavations made in the middle of the sand would bring to light a large number of arms and instruments of Egyptian origin.” 
 
“That is evident,” I replied; “and for the sake of archaeologists let us hope that these excavations will be made sooner or later, when new towns are established on the isthmus, after the construction of the Suez Canal; a canal, however, very useless to a vessel like the _Nautilus_.” 
 
“Very likely; but useful to the whole world,” said Captain Nemo. “['The ancients', 'their', 'they'] well understood the utility of a communication between ['the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea'] and the Mediterranean for ['The ancients', 'their', 'they'] commercial affairs: but ['The ancients', 'their', 'they'] did not think of digging a canal direct, and took ['the Nile', 'the Nile', 'the Nile'] as an intermediate. Very probably ['the canal which united the Nile to the Red Sea', 'this canal', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'T['the Nile', 'the Nile', 'the Nile']l', ['the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea'] was begun by Sesostris, if we may believe tradition. One thing is certain, that in the year 615 before Jesus Christ, Necos undertook the works of an alimentary canal to the waters of ['the Nile', 'the Nile', 'the Nile'] across the plain of ['Egypt', 'Egypt'], looking towards Arabia. It took four days to go up ['the canal which united the Nile to the Red Sea', 'this canal', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'This canal', 'it', 'it'], and ['the canal which united the Nile to the Red Sea', 'this canal', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'This canal', 'it', 'it'] was so wide that two triremes could go abreast. ['the canal which united the Nile to the Red Sea', 'this canal', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'This canal', 'it', 'it'] was carried on by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, and probably finished by Ptolemy II. Strabo saw ['the canal which united the Nile to the Red Sea', 'this canal', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'This canal', 'it', 'it'] navigated: but ['the canal which united the Nile to the Red Sea', 'this canal', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'This canal', 'it', 'it'] decline from the point of departure, near Bubastes, to ['the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea'] was so slight that ['the canal which united the Nile to the Red Sea', 'this canal', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'This canal', 'it', 'it'] was only navigable for a few months in the year. ['the canal which united the Nile to the Red Sea', 'this canal', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'This canal', 'it', 'it'] answered all commercial purposes to the age of Antonius, when ['the canal which united the Nile to the Red Sea', 'this canal', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'This canal', 'it', 'it'] was abandoned and blocked up with sand. Restored by order of the Caliph Omar, ['the canal which united the Nile to the Red Sea', 'this canal', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'This canal', 'it', 'it'] was definitely destroyed in 761 or 762 by ['Caliph Al-Mansor, who wished to prevent the arrival of provisions to Mohammed-ben-Abdallah, who had revolted against him', 'hi['Caliph Al-Mansor, who wished to prevent the arrival of provisions to Mohammed-ben-Abdallah, who had revolted against him', 'him']. During the expedition into ['Egypt', 'Egypt'], ['your General Bonaparte', 'he', 'him'] discovered traces of the works in the Desert of Suez; and, surprised by the tide, ['your General Bonaparte', 'he', 'him'] nearly perished before regaining ['Hadjaroth', 'the very place where Moses had encamped three thousand years before him'], at ['Hadjaroth', 'the very place where Moses had encamped three thousand years before hi['your General Bonaparte', 'he', 'him'].” 
 
“Well, Captain, what the ancients dared not undertake, this junction between the two seas, which will shorten the road from Cadiz to India, ['M. Lesseps', 'he'] has succeeded in doing; and before long ['M. Lesseps', 'he'] will have changed Africa into an immense island.” 
 
“Yes, ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'your']; ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'your'] have the right to be proud of ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'yo['your countryman', 'He', 'he', 'he']. Such a man brings more honour to a nation than great captains. ['your countryman', 'He', 'he', 'he'] began, like so many others, with disgust and rebuffs; but ['your countryman', 'He', 'he', 'he'] has triumphed, for ['your countryman', 'He', 'he', 'he'] has the genius of will. And it is sad to think that a work like that, which ought to have been an international work and which would have sufficed to make a reign illustrious, should have succeeded by the energy of ['one man', 'M. Lesseps']. All honour to ['one man', 'M. Lesseps']!” 
 
“Yes! honour to the great citizen,” I replied, surprised by the manner in which Captain Nemo had just spoken. 
 
“Unfortunately,” ['he', 'I'] continued, “['he', 'I'] cannot take ['you', 'you'] through the Suez Canal; but ['you', 'you'] will be able to see the long jetty of Port Said after to-morrow, when we shall be in the Mediterranean.” 
 
“The Mediterranean!” I exclaimed. 
 
“Yes, ['sir', 'you']; does that astonish ['sir', 'you']?” 
 
“What astonishes me is to think that we shall be there the day after to-morrow.” 
 
“Indeed?” 
 
“Yes, ['Captain', 'your'], although by this time ['I', 'myself', 'I'] ought to have accustomed ['I', 'myself', 'I'] to be surprised at nothing since ['I', 'myself', 'I'] have been on board ['Captain', 'your'] boat.” 
 
“But the cause of this surprise?” 
 
“Well! it is the fearful speed you will have to put on the _Nautilus_, if the day after to-morrow she is to be in the Mediterranean, having made the round of Africa, and doubled the Cape of Good Hope!” 
 
“Who told ['you', 'sir'] that she would make the round of Africa and double the Cape of Good Hope, ['you', 'sir']?” 
 
“Well, unless the _Nautilus_ sails on dry land, and passes above the isthmus——” 
 
“Or beneath it, M. Aronnax.” 
 
“Beneath it?” 
 
“Certainly,” replied Captain Nemo quietly. “A long time ago Nature made under ['this tongue of land', 'its'] what man has this day made on ['this tongue of land', 'its'] surface.” 
 
“What! such a passage exists?” 
 
“Yes; ['a subterranean passage, which I have named the Arabian Tunnel', 'It']. ['a subterranean passage, which I have named the Arabian Tunnel', 'It'] takes us beneath Suez and opens into the Gulf of Pelusium.” 
 
“But this isthmus is composed of nothing but quick sands?” 
 
“To a certain depth. But at fifty-five yards only there is a solid layer of rock.” 
 
“Did you discover this passage by chance?” I asked more and more surprised. 
 
“Chance and reasoning, ['sir', 'sir', 'you']; and by reasoning even more than by chance. Not only does ['this passage', 'it'] exist, but ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] have profited by ['this passage', 'it'] several times. Without that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] should not have ventured this day into ['the impassable Red Sea', 'the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea', 'the sea']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] noticed that in ['the impassable Red Sea', 'the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea', 'the sea'] and in ['the Mediterranean', 'the Mediterranean'] there existed a certain number of fishes of a kind perfectly identical. Certain of the fact, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] asked ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] was it possible that there was no communication between ['the two seas', 'the two']? If there was, the subterranean current must necessarily run from ['the impassable Red Sea', 'the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea', 'the sea'] to ['the Mediterranean', 'the Mediterranean'], from the sole cause of difference of level. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] caught ['a large number of fishes', 'their', 'them'] in the neighbourhood of Suez. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] passed ['a copper ring', 'the ring'] through ['a large number of fishes', 'their', 'them'] tails, and threw ['a large number of fishes', 'their', 'them'] back into ['the impassable Red Sea', 'the Red Sea', 'the Red Sea', 'the sea']. Some months later, on the coast of Syria, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] caught some of ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] fish ornamented with ['a copper ring', 'the ring']. Thus ['the communication between the two', 'it', 'it'['the two seas', 'the two'] was proved. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] then sought for ['the communication between the two', 'it', 'it', 'it'] with ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] _Nautilus;_ ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] discovered ['the communication between the two', 'it', 'it', 'it'], ventured into ['the communication between the two', 'it', 'it', 'it'], and before long, ['sir', 'sir', 'you'], ['sir', 'sir', 'you'] too will have passed through ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] Arabian tunnel!” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER V THE ARABIAN TUNNEL 
 
That same evening, in 21° 30′ N. lat., ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'herself'] floated on the surface of the sea, approaching the Arabian coast. ['I', 'I'] saw ['Djeddah, the most important counting-house of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and India', 'its', 'the town', 'Djeddah']. ['I', 'I'] distinguished clearly enough ['Djeddah, the most important counting-house of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and India', 'its', 'the town', 'Djeddah'] buildings, the vessels anchored at the quays, and ['those whose draught of water obliged them to an['those whose draught of water obliged them to anchor in the roads', 'them'] in the roads', 'them']. The sun, rather low on the horizon, struck full on ['the houses of the town', ['Djeddah, the most important counting-house of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and India', 'its', 'the town', 'Djeddah'], bringing out ['the houses of the town', 'their'] whiteness. Outside, some wooden cabins, and some made of reeds, showed the quarter inhabited by the Bedouins. Soon ['Djeddah, the most important counting-house of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and India', 'its', 'the town', 'Djeddah'] was shut out from view by the shadows of night, and ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'herself'] found ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'herself'] under water slightly phosphorescent. 
 
The next day, the 10th of February, we sighted several ships running to windward. ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'her', 'she', 'her'] returned to ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'her', 'she', 'her'] submarine navigation; but at noon, when ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'her', 'she', 'her'] bearings were taken, the sea being deserted, ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'her', 'she', 'her'] rose again to ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'her', 'she', 'her'] waterline. 
 
Accompanied by Ned and Conseil, ['I', 'myself'] seated ['I', 'myself'] on the platform. The coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a damp fog. 
 
We were leaning on the sides of the pinnace, talking of one thing and another, when ['Ned Land', 'his'], stretching out ['Ned Land', 'his'] hand towards a spot on the sea, said: 
 
“Do ['you', 'sir'] see anything there, ['you', 'sir']?” 
 
“No, ['Ned', 'your'],” ['I', 'I'] replied; “but ['I', 'I'] have not ['Ned', 'your'] eyes, you know.” 
 
“Look well,” said ['Ned', 'you'], “there, on the starboard beam, about the height of the lantern! Do ['Ned', 'you'] not see a mass which seems to move?” 
 
“Certainly,” said ['I', 'I'], after close attention; “['I', 'I'] see something like a long black body on the top of the water.” 
 
And certainly before long ['the black object', 'It', 'It'] was not more than a mile from us. ['the black object', 'It', 'It'] looked like a great sandbank deposited in the open sea. ['the black object', 'It', 'It'] was a gigantic dugong! 
 
['Ned Land', 'His', 'His', 'he', 'himself'] looked eagerly. ['Ned Land', 'His', 'His', 'he', 'himself'] eyes shone with covetousness at the sight of ['the animal', 'it', 'it', 'its']. ['Ned Land', 'His', 'His', 'he', 'himself'] hand seemed ready to harpoon ['the animal', 'it', 'it', 'its']. One would have thought ['Ned Land', 'His', 'His', 'he', 'himself'] was awaiting the moment to throw ['Ned Land', 'His', 'His', 'he', 'himself'] into the sea and attack ['the animal', 'it', 'it', 'its'] in ['the animal', 'it', 'it', 'its'] element. 
 
At this instant ['Captain Nemo', 'He'] appeared on the platform. ['Captain Nemo', 'He'] saw ['the dugong', 'the Canadian’s', 'him'], understood ['the dugong', 'the Canadian’s', 'him'] attitude, and, addressing ['the dugong', 'the Canadian’s', 'him'], said: 
 
“If ['you', 'Master Land', 'your'] held ['a harpoon', 'it'] just now, ['you', 'Master Land', 'your'], would ['a harpoon', 'it'] not burn ['you', 'Master Land', 'your'] hand?” 
 
“Just so, sir.” 
 
“And ['you', 'your', 'you'] would not be sorry to go back, for one day, to ['you', 'your', 'you'] trade of a fisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those ['you', 'your', 'you'] have already killed?” 
 
“I should not, sir.” 
 
“Well, you can try.” 
 
“Thank ['you', 'sir'], ['you', 'sir'],” said ['Ned Land', 'his'], ['Ned Land', 'his'] eyes flaming. 
 
“Only,” continued ['the Captain', 'I'], “['the Captain', 'I'] advise ['you', 'your'] for ['you', 'your'] own sake not to miss the creature.” 
 
“Is the dugong dangerous to attack?” I asked, in spite of the Canadian’s shrug of the shoulders. 
 
“Yes,” replied the Captain; “sometimes ['the animal', 'its'] turns upon ['the animal', 'it['its assailants', 'their'] and overturns ['its assailants', 'their'] boat. But for ['Master Land', 'His', 'his'] this danger is not to be feared. ['Master Land', 'His', 'his'] eye is prompt, ['Master Land', 'His', 'his'] arm sure.” 
 
At this moment seven men of the crew, mute and immovable as ever, mounted the platform. One carried a harpoon and a line similar to those employed in catching whales. ['The pinnace', 'its'] was lifted from the bridge, pulled from ['The pinnace', 'its'] socket, and let down into the sea. ['Six oarsmen', 'their'] took ['Six oarsmen', 'their'] seats, and the coxswain went to the tiller. Ned, Conseil, and I went to the back of the boat. 
 
“['You', 'Captain'] are not coming, ['You', 'Captain']?” I asked. 
 
“No, ['sir', 'I', 'you']; but ['sir', 'I', 'you'] wish ['sir', 'I', 'you'] good sport.” 
 
The boat put off, and, lifted by the six rowers, drew rapidly towards the dugong, which floated about two miles from the _Nautilus_. 
 
Arrived some cables-length from the cetacean, the speed slackened, and the oars dipped noiselessly into ['the quiet waters', 'the water']. Ned Land, harpoon in hand, stood in the fore part of the boat. ['The harpoon used for striking the whale', 'it'] is generally attached to ['a very long cord which runs out rapidly as the wounded cr['the wounded creature', 'him']r him',['The harpoon used for striking the whale', 'it']the cor['the wounded creature', 'him']. But here ['a very long cord which runs out rapidly as the wounded creature draws it after him', 'the cord'] was not more than ten fathoms long, and the extremity was attached to a small barrel which, by floating, was to show the course the dugong took under ['the quiet waters', 'the water']. 
 
I stood and carefully watched ['the Canadian’s adversary', 'This dugong, which also bears the name of the halicore', 'its', 'its', 'Its', 'its']. ['the Canadian’s adversary', 'This dugong, which also bears the name of the halicore', 'its', 'its', 'Its', 'its'], closely resembles ['the manatee', 'the manatee']; ['the Canadian’s adversary', 'This dugong, which also bears the name of the halicore', 'its', 'its', 'Its', 'its'] oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail, and ['the Canadian’s adversary', 'This dugong, which also bears the name of the halicore', 'its', 'its', 'Its', 'its'] lateral fins in perfect fingers. ['the Canadian’s adversary', 'This dugong, which also bears the name of the halicore', 'its', 'its', 'Its', 'its'] difference from ['the manatee', 'the manatee'] consisted in ['the Canadian’s adversary', 'This dugong, which also bears the name of the halicore', 'its', 'its', 'Its', 'its'] upper jaw, which was armed with two long and pointed teeth which formed on each side diverging tusks. 
 
['This dugong which Ned Land was preparing to attack', 'it', 'It', 'it'] was of colossal dimensions; ['This dugong which Ned Land was preparing to attack', 'it', 'It', 'it'] was more than seven yards long. ['This dugong which Ned Land was preparing to attack', 'it', 'It', 'it'] did not move, and seemed to be sleeping on the waves, which circumstance made ['This dugong which Ned Land was preparing to attack', 'it', 'It', 'it'] easier to capture. 
 
The boat approached within six yards of the animal. The oars rested on the rowlocks. I half rose. ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his'], ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his'] body thrown a little back, brandished the harpoon in ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his'] experienced hand. 
 
Suddenly a hissing noise was heard, and the dugong disappeared. The harpoon, although thrown with great force; had apparently only struck the water. 
 
“Curse ['it', 'it']!” exclaimed ['the Canadian', 'I'] furiously; “['the Canadian', 'I'] have missed ['it', 'it']!” 
 
“No,” said ['I', 'your']; “['the creature', 'his'] is wounded—look at the blood; but ['I', 'your'] weapon has not stuck in ['the creature', 'his'] body.” 
 
“['My', 'my', 'Ned Land'] harpoon! ['My', 'my', 'Ned Land'] harpoon!” cried ['My', 'my', 'Ned Land']. 
 
The sailors rowed on, and ['the coxswain', 'the animal'] made for the floating barrel. The harpoon regained, we followed in pursuit of ['the coxswain', 'the animal']. 
 
['The latter', 'Its', 'it', 'it'] came now and then to the surface to breathe. ['The latter', 'Its', 'it', 'it'] wound had not weakened ['The latter', 'Its', 'it', 'it'], for ['The latter', 'Its', 'it', 'it'] shot onwards with great rapidity. 
 
['The boat, rowed by strong arms', 'its', 'it'], flew on ['The boat, rowed by strong arms', 'its', 'it'] track. Several times ['The boat, rowed by strong arms', 'its', 'it'] approached within some few yards, and the Canadian was ready to strike, but ['the dugong', 'it'] made off with a sudden plunge, and it was impossible to reach ['the dugong', 'it']. 
 
Imagine the passion which excited ['impatient Ned Land', 'He']! ['impatient Ned Land', 'He'] hurled at ['the unfortunate creature', 'the dugong'] the most energetic expletives in the English tongue. For ['my', 'I'] part, ['my', 'I'] was only vexed to see ['the unfortunate creature', 'the dugong'] escape all our attacks. 
 
['We', 'us'] pursued ['it', 'it'] without relaxation for an hour, and I began to think ['it', 'it'] would prove difficult to capture, when ['the animal', 'he', 'its'], possessed with the perverse idea of vengeance of which ['the animal', 'he', 'its'] had cause to repent, turned upon the pinnace and assailed ['We', 'us'] in ['the animal', 'he', 'its'] turn. 
 
This manœuvre did not escape the Canadian. 
 
“Look out!” he cried. 
 
['The coxswain', 'his'] said some words in ['The coxswain', 'his'] outlandish tongue, doubtless warning ['the men', 'their'] to keep on ['the men', 'their'] guard. 
 
['The dugong', 'its', 'its', 'he', 'himself'] came within twenty feet of the boat, stopped, sniffed the air briskly with ['The dugong', 'its', 'its', 'he', 'himself'] large nostrils (not pierced at the extremity, but in the upper part of ['The dugong', 'its', 'its', 'he', 'himself'] muzzle). Then, taking a spring, ['The dugong', 'its', 'its', 'he', 'himself'] threw ['The dugong', 'its', 'its', 'he', 'himself'] upon us. 
 
['The pinnace', 'it', 'the gigantic animal', 'the creature’s', 'it', 'the whole thing', 'the beast', 'it'] could not avoid the shock, and half upset, shipped at least two tons of water, which had to be emptied; but, thanks to the coxswain, ['we', 'we', 'We'] caught ['The pinnace', 'it', 'the gigantic animal', 'the creature’s', 'it', 'the whole thing', 'the beast', 'it'] sideways, not full front, so ['we', 'we', 'We'] were not quite overturned. While ['Ned Land', 'his'], clinging to the bows, belaboured ['The pinnace', 'it', 'the gigantic animal', 'the creature’s', 'it', 'the whole thing', 'the beast', 'it'] with blows from ['Ned Land', 'his'] harpoon, ['The pinnace', 'it', 'the gigantic animal', 'the creature’s', 'it', 'the whole thing', 'the beast', 'it'] teeth were buried in the gunwale, and ['The pinnace', 'it', 'the gigantic animal', 'the creature’s', 'it', 'the whole thing', 'the beast', 'it'] lifted ['The pinnace', 'it', 'the gigantic animal', 'the creature’s', 'it', 'the whole thing', 'the beast', 'it'] out of the water, as a lion does a roebuck. ['we', 'we', 'We'] were upset over one another, and I know not how the adventure would have ended, if the Canadian, still enraged with ['The pinnace', 'it', 'the gigantic animal', 'the creature’s', 'it', 'the whole thing', 'the beast', 'it'], had not struck ['The pinnace', 'it', 'the gigantic animal', 'the creature’s', 'it', 'the whole thing', 'the beast', 'it'] to the heart. 
 
I heard ['its', 'the dugong', 'him', 'the animal'] teeth grind on the iron plate, and ['its', 'the dugong', 'him', 'the animal'] disappeared, carrying the harpoon with ['its', 'the dugong', 'him', 'the animal']. But the barrel soon returned to the surface, and shortly after ['the body of the animal', 'its', '['its', 'the dugong', 'him', 'the animal'], turned on ['the body of the animal', 'its', 'it', 'it'] back. The boat came up with ['the body of the animal', 'its', 'it', 'it'], took ['the body of the animal', 'its', 'it', 'it'] in tow, and made straight for the _Nautilus_. 
 
It required tackle of enormous strength to hoist ['the dugong', 'It'] on to the platform. ['the dugong', 'It'] weighed 10,000 lbs. 
 
The next day, 11th February, the larder of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its'] was enriched by some more delicate game. ['A flight of sea-swallows', 'They'] rested on ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its']. ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its'] was a species of the Sterna nilotica, peculiar to Egypt; ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its'] beak is black, head grey and pointed, the eye surrounded by white spots, the back, wings, and tail of a greyish colour, the belly and throat white, and claws red. ['A flight of sea-swallows', 'They'] also took some dozen of ['Nile ducks, a wild bird of high flavour', 'its'], ['Nile ducks, a wild bird of high flavour', 'its'] throat and upper part of the head white with black spots. 
 
About five o’clock in the evening we sighted to the north ['the Cape of Ras-Mohammed', 'This cape']. ['the Cape of Ras-Mohammed', 'This cape'] forms the extremity of Arabia Petraea, comprised between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Acabah. 
 
The _Nautilus_ penetrated into the Straits of Jubal, which leads to the Gulf of Suez. I distinctly saw ['a high mountain, towering between the two gulfs of Ras-Mohammed', 'It']. ['a high mountain, towering between the two gulfs of Ras-Mohammed', 'It'] was Mount Horeb, that Sinai at the top of which Moses saw God face to face. 
 
At six o’clock the _Nautilus_, sometimes floating, sometimes immersed, passed some distance from Tor, situated at the end of the bay, the waters of which seemed tinted with red, an observation already made by Captain Nemo. Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence, sometimes broken by the cries of the pelican and other night-birds, and the noise of the waves breaking upon the shore, chafing against the rocks, or the panting of ['some far-off steamer', 'its'] beating the waters of the Gulf with ['some far-off steamer', 'its'] noisy paddles. 
 
From eight to nine o’clock the _Nautilus_ remained some fathoms under the water. According to ['my', 'I'] calculation ['we', 'our', 'We', 'us'] must have been very near Suez. Through the panel of the saloon ['my', 'I'] saw the bottom of the rocks brilliantly lit up by ['we', 'our', 'We', 'us'] electric lamp. ['we', 'our', 'We', 'us'] seemed to be leaving the Straits behind ['we', 'our', 'We', 'us'] more and more. 
 
At a quarter-past nine, the vessel having returned to the surface, ['I', 'I'] mounted the platform. Most impatient to pass through Captain Nemo’s tunnel, ['I', 'I'] could not stay in one place, so came to breathe the fresh night air. 
 
Soon in the shadow I saw a pale light, half discoloured by the fog, shining about a mile from us. 
 
“A floating lighthouse!” said someone near me. 
 
I turned, and saw the Captain. 
 
“It is the floating light of Suez,” he continued. “It will not be long before we gain the entrance of the tunnel.” 
 
“The entrance cannot be easy?” 
 
“No, ['sir', 'you', 'M. Aronnax']; for that reason ['I', 'myself'] am accustomed to go into the steersman’s cage and ['I', 'myself'] direct ['our', 'we'] course. And now, if ['sir', 'you', 'M. Aronnax'] will go down, ['sir', 'you', 'M. Aronnax'], the _Nautilus_ is going under the waves, and will not return to the surface until ['our', 'we'] have passed through the Arabian Tunnel.” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'he'] led me towards the central staircase; half way down ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] opened a door, traversed the upper deck, and landed in the pilot’s cage, which it may be remembered rose at the extremity of the platform. ['It', 'the cabin'] was a cabin measuring six feet square, very much like that occupied by the pilot on the steamboats of the Mississippi or Hudson. In the midst worked ['a wheel', 'the wheel'], placed vertically, and caught to the tiller-rope, which ran to the back of the _Nautilus_. Four light-ports with lenticular glasses, let in a groove in the partition of ['It', 'the cabin'], allowed the man at ['a wheel', 'the wheel'] to see in all directions. 
 
['This cabin', 'the cabin'] was dark; but soon ['my eyes', 'thems['my', 'I']ves'] accustomed ['my eyes', 'themselves'] to the obscurity, and ['my', 'I'] perceived ['the pilot, a strong man, with his hands['the pilot, a strong man, with his hands resting on the spokes of the wheel', 'his']sting on the spokes of the wheel', 'his']. Outside, the sea appeared vividly lit up by ['the lantern, which shed its rays ['the lantern, which shed its rays from the back of the cabin to the other extremity of the platform', 'its']m the back of the cabin['This cabin', 'the cabin']ther extremity of the platform', 'its']. 
 
“Now,” said Captain Nemo, “let ['us', 'our'] try to make ['us', 'our'] passage.” 
 
Electric wires connected ['the pilot’s', 'the Captain', 'his', 'He'] cage with the machinery room, and from there ['the pilot’s', 'the Captain', 'his', 'He'] could communicate simultaneously to ['the pilot’s', 'the Captain', 'his', 'He'] _Nautilus_ the direction and the speed. ['the pilot’s', 'the Captain', 'his', 'He'] pressed a metal knob, and at once the speed of the screw diminished. 
 
I looked in silence at ['the high straight wall we were ['we', 'We']nning by at this moment, the immovable base of a massive sandy coast', 'it']. ['we', 'We'] followed ['the high straight wall we were running by at this moment, the immovable base of a massive sandy coast', 'it'] thus for an hour only some few yards off. 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the pilot'] did not take ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the pilot'] eye from ['the knob, suspended by its two c['the knob, suspended by its two concentric circles in the cabin', 'its']entric circles in the cabin', 'its']. At a simple gesture, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the pilot'] modified the course of the _Nautilus_ every instant. 
 
['I', 'myself'] had placed ['I', 'myself'] at the port-scuttle, and saw ['some magnificent substructures of coral, zoophytes, seaweed, and fucus', 'their'], agitating ['some magnificent substructures of coral, zoophytes, seaweed, and fucus', 'their'] enormous claws, which stretched out from the fissures of the rock. 
 
At a quarter-past ten, ['the Captain himself', 'hi['the Captain himself', 'himself'] took the helm. ['A large gallery, black and deep', 'it', 'its'], opened before us. ['The _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] went boldly into ['A large gallery, black and deep', 'it', 'its']. A strange roaring was heard round ['A large gallery, black and deep', 'it', 'its'] sides. It was the waters of the Red Sea, which the incline of the tunnel precipitated violently towards the Mediterranean. ['The _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] went with the torrent, rapid as an arrow, in spite of the efforts of the machinery, which, in order to offer more effective resistance, beat the waves with reversed screw. 
 
On the walls of the narrow passage ['I', 'My'] could see nothing but brilliant rays, straight lines, furrows of fire, traced by the great speed, under the brilliant electric light. ['I', 'My'] heart beat fast. 
 
At thirty-five minutes past ten, Captain Nemo quitted the helm, and, turning to me, said: 
 
“The Mediterranean!” 
 
In less than twenty minutes, the _Nautilus_, carried along by the torrent, had passed through the Isthmus of Suez. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER VI THE GRECIAN ARCHIPELAGO 
 
The next day, the 12th of February, at the dawn of day, the _Nautilus_ rose to the surface. ['I', 'me'] hastened on to the platform. Three miles to the south the dim outline of Pelusium was to be seen. A torrent had carried us from one sea to another. About seven o’clock Ned and Conseil joined ['I', 'me']. 
 
“Well, Sir Naturalist,” said the Canadian, in a slightly jovial tone, “and the Mediterranean?” 
 
“We are floating on its surface, friend Ned.” 
 
“What!” said Conseil, “this very night.” 
 
“Yes, this very night; in a few minutes we have passed this impassable isthmus.” 
 
“['I', 'the Canadian'] do not believe it,” replied ['I', 'the Canadian']. 
 
“Then ['you', 'Master Land'] are wrong, ['you', 'Master Land'],” I continued; “this low coast which rounds off to the south is the Egyptian coast. And you who have such good eyes, ['Ned', 'you'], ['Ned', 'you'] can see the jetty of Port Said stretching into the sea.” 
 
The Canadian looked attentively. 
 
“Certainly ['you', 'sir', 'your', 'you'] are right, ['you', 'sir', 'your', 'you'], and ['you', 'sir', 'your', 'you'] Captain is a first-rate man. ['We', 'us', 'our', 'us'] are in the Mediterranean. Good! Now, if ['you', 'sir', 'your', 'you'] please, let ['We', 'us', 'our', 'us'] talk of ['We', 'us', 'our', 'us'] own little affair, but so that no one hears ['We', 'us', 'our', 'us'].” 
 
['I', 'I'] saw what ['the Canadian', 'him', 'he'] wanted, and, in any case, ['I', 'I'] thought it better to let ['the Canadian', 'him', 'he'] talk, as ['the Canadian', 'him', 'he'] wished it; so ['we all three', 'we'] went and sat down near the lantern, where ['we all three', 'we'] were less exposed to the spray of the blades. 
 
“Now, ['Ned', 'you'], ['we', 'us'] listen; what have ['Ned', 'you'] to tell ['we', 'us']?” 
 
“What ['I', 'I'] have to tell you is very simple. ['We', 'us', 'us'] are in Europe; and before Captain Nemo’s caprices drag ['We', 'us', 'us'] once more to the bottom of the Polar Seas, or lead ['We', 'us', 'us'] into Oceania, ['I', 'I'] ask to leave the _Nautilus_.” 
 
['I', 'my', 'I'] wished in no way to shackle the liberty of ['I', 'my', 'I'] companions, but ['I', 'my', 'I'] certainly felt no desire to leave Captain Nemo. 
 
Thanks to ['him', 'his'], and thanks to ['him', 'his'] apparatus, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] was each day nearer the completion of ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] submarine studies; and ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] was rewriting ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself['my book of submarine depths in its very ['my book of submarine depths in its very element', 'its']ment', 'its']. Should ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] ever again have such an opportunity of observing the wonders of the ocean? No, certainly not! And ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] could not bring ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself'] to the idea of abandoning the _Nautilus_ before the cycle of investigation was accomplished. 
 
“['Friend Ned', 'you', 'you'], answer me frankly, are ['Friend Ned', 'you', 'you'] tired of being on board? Are ['Friend Ned', 'you', 'you'] sorry that destiny has thrown us into Captain Nemo’s hands?” 
 
['The Canadian', 'his', 'he'] remained some moments without answering. Then, crossing ['The Canadian', 'his', 'he'] arms, ['The Canadian', 'his', 'he'] said: 
 
“Frankly, ['I', 'I', 'my'] do not regret this journey under the seas. ['I', 'I', 'my'] shall be glad to have made ['it', 'it', 'it']; but, now that ['it', 'it', 'it'] is made, let us have done with ['it', 'it', 'it']. That is ['I', 'I', 'my'] idea.” 
 
“It will come to an end, Ned.” 
 
“Where and when?” 
 
“Where ['I', 'I', 'I'] do not know—when ['I', 'I', 'I'] cannot say; or, rather, ['I', 'I', 'I'] suppose it will end when these seas have nothing more to teach us.” 
 
“Then what do you hope for?” demanded the Canadian. 
 
“That circumstances may occur as well six months hence as now by which we may and ought to profit.” 
 
“Oh!” said Ned Land, “and where shall we be in six months, if ['you', 'Sir Naturalist'] please, ['you', 'Sir Naturalist']?” 
 
“Perhaps in China; you know ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'It', 'it'] is a rapid traveller. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'It', 'it'] goes through water as swallows through the air, or as an express on the land. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'It', 'it'] does not fear frequented seas; who can say that ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'It', 'it'] may not beat the coasts of France, England, or America, on which flight may be attempted as advantageously as here.” 
 
“['M. Aronnax', 'your', 'You'],” replied ['the Canadian', 'I'], “['M. Aronnax', 'your', 'You'] arguments are rotten at the foundation. ['M. Aronnax', 'your', 'You'] speak in the future, ‘['We', 'we', 'We', 'we'] shall be there! ['We', 'we', 'We', 'we'] shall be here!’ ['the Canadian', 'I'] speak in the present, ‘['We', 'we', 'We', 'we'] ['are', 'it'] here, and ['We', 'we', 'We', 'we'] must profit by ['are', 'it'].’” 
 
Ned Land’s logic pressed ['me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] hard, and ['me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] felt ['me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] beaten on that ground. ['me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] knew not what argument would now tell in ['me', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my'] favour. 
 
“Sir,” continued Ned, “let us suppose an impossibility: if Captain Nemo should this day offer ['you', 'your', 'you'] ['you', 'your', 'y['your liberty', 'it']; would ['you', 'your', 'you'] accept ['your liberty', 'it']?” 
 
“['I', 'I'] do not know,” ['I', 'I'] answered. 
 
“And if,” he added, “['the offer made you this['you', 'you']y', 'it'] was never to be renewed, would ['you', 'you'] accept ['the offer made you this day', 'it']?” 
 
“['Friend Ned', 'Your'], this is ['my', 'me'] answer. ['Friend Ned', 'Your'] reasoning is against ['my', 'me']. ['We', 'us', 'us'] must not rely on ['Captain Nemo’s', 'him'] good-will. Common prudence forbids ['Captain Nemo’s', 'him'] to set ['We', 'us', 'us'] at liberty. On the other side, prudence bids ['We', 'us', 'us'] profit by the first opportunity to leave the _Nautilus_.” 
 
“Well, M. Aronnax, that is wisely said.” 
 
“Only one observation—just one. The occasion must be serious, and ['our firs['our', 'we', 'us']ttempt', 'it'] must succeed; if ['our first attempt', 'it'] fails, ['our', 'we', 'us'] shall never find another, and Captain Nemo will never forgive ['our', 'we', 'us'].” 
 
“All that is true,” replied ['the Canadian', 'your']. “But ['the Canadian', 'your'] observation applies equally to all attempts at flight, whether in two years’ time, or in two days’. But the question is still this: If ['a favourable opportunity', 'itself', 'it'] presents ['a favourable opportunity', 'itself', 'it'], ['a favourable opportunity', 'itself', 'it'] must be seized.” 
 
“Agreed! And now, ['Ned', 'you', 'you'], will ['Ned', 'you', 'you'] tell me what ['Ned', 'you', 'you'] mean by a favourable opportunity?” 
 
“It will be that which, on a dark night, will bring the _Nautilus_ a short distance from some European coast.” 
 
“And you will try and save yourself by swimming?” 
 
“Yes, if we were near enough to ['the bank', 'the bank'], and if ['the vessel', 'the boat'] was floating at the time. Not if ['the bank', 'the bank'] was far away, and ['the vessel', 'the boat'] was under the water.” 
 
“And in that case?” 
 
“In that case, ['I', 'myself', 'I'] should seek to make ['I', 'myself', 'I'] master of ['the pinnace', 'it']. ['I', 'myself', 'I'] know how ['the pinnace', 'it'] is worked. ['We', 'we', 'our'] must get inside, and the bolts once drawn, ['We', 'we', 'our'] shall come to the surface of the water, without even the pilot, who is in the bows, perceiving ['We', 'we', 'our'] flight.” 
 
“Well, Ned, watch for the opportunity; but do not forget that a hitch will ruin us.” 
 
“I will not forget, sir.” 
 
“And now, ['Ned', 'you', 'your'], would ['Ned', 'you', 'your'] like to know what I think of ['Ned', 'you', 'your'] project?” 
 
“Certainly, M. Aronnax.” 
 
“Well, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] think—['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] do not say ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] hope—['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] think that ['this favourable opportunity', 'itself'] will never present ['this favourable opportunity', 'itself'].” 
 
“Why not?” 
 
“Because ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'he', 'his'] cannot hide from ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'he', 'his'] that ['we', 'our'] have not given up all hope of regaining ['we', 'our'] liberty, and ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'he', 'his'] will be on ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'he', 'his'] guard, above all, in the seas and in the sight of European coasts.” 
 
“We shall see,” replied ['Ned Land', 'his'], shaking ['Ned Land', 'his'] head determinedly. 
 
“And now, ['Ned Land', 'you', 'you', 'you'],” ['I', 'I'] added, “let ['us', 'us', 'we'] stop here. Not another word on the subject. The day that ['Ned Land', 'you', 'you', 'you'] are ready, come and let ['us', 'us', 'we'] know, and ['us', 'us', 'we'] will follow ['Ned Land', 'you', 'you', 'you']. ['I', 'I'] rely entirely upon ['Ned Land', 'you', 'you', 'you'].” 
 
Thus ended a conversation which, at no very distant time, led to such grave results. ['I', 'my', 'I'] must say here that facts seemed to confirm ['I', 'my', 'I'] foresight, to the Canadian’s great despair. Did ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself'] distrust ['us', 'we', 'we'] in these frequented seas? or did ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself'] only wish to hide ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself'] from the numerous vessels, of all nations, which ploughed the Mediterranean? ['I', 'my', 'I'] could not tell; but ['us', 'we', 'we'] were oftener between waters and far from the coast. Or, if ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] did emerge, nothing was to be seen but the pilot’s cage; and sometimes ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] went to great depths, for, between the Grecian Archipelago and Asia Minor ['us', 'we', 'we'] could not touch the bottom by more than a thousand fathoms. 
 
Thus I only knew we were near the Island of Carpathos, one of the Sporades, by Captain Nemo reciting these lines from Virgil: 
 
“Est Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates, Caeruleus Proteus,” 
 
as he pointed to a spot on the planisphere. 
 
['It', 'the saloon'] was indeed the ancient abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of Neptune’s flocks, now the Island of Scarpanto, situated between Rhodes and Crete. I saw nothing but the granite base through the glass panels of ['It', 'the saloon']. 
 
The next day, the 14th of February, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] resolved to employ some hours in studying the fishes of the Archipelago; but for some reason or other the panels remained hermetically sealed. Upon taking the course of the _Nautilus_, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] found that we were going towards Candia, the ancient Isle of Crete. At the time ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] embarked on the _Abraham Lincoln_, the whole of this island had risen in insurrection against the despotism of the Turks. But how the insurgents had fared since that time ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] was absolutely ignorant, and it was not Captain Nemo, deprived of all land communications, who could tell ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me']. 
 
['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my'] made no allusion to this event when that night ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my'] found ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my'] alone with ['him', 'he', 'his', 'he'] in the saloon. Besides, ['him', 'he', 'his', 'he'] seemed to be taciturn and preoccupied. Then, contrary to ['him', 'he', 'his', 'he'] custom, ['him', 'he', 'his', 'he'] ordered both panels to be opened, and, going from one to the other, observed the mass of waters attentively. To what end ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my'] could not guess; so, on ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my'] side, ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my'] employed ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my'] time in studying the fish passing before ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my'] eyes. 
 
In the midst of the waters ['a man', 'his', 'It', 'it'] appeared, a diver, carrying at ['a man', 'his', 'It', 'it'] belt a leathern purse. ['a man', 'his', 'It', 'it'] was not a body abandoned to the waves; ['a man', 'his', 'It', 'it'] was a living man, swimming with a strong hand, disappearing occasionally to take breath at the surface. 
 
I turned towards Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice exclaimed: 
 
“['A man', 'He'] shipwrecked! ['A man', 'He'] must be saved at any price!” 
 
[Illustration] “A man! A shipwrecked sailor!” I cried 
 
The Captain did not answer me, but came and leaned against the panel. 
 
['The man', 'his'] had approached, and, with ['The man', 'his'] face flattened against the glass, was looking at us. 
 
To my great amazement, Captain Nemo signed to ['him', 'The diver', 'his']. ['him', 'The diver', 'his'] answered with ['him', 'The diver', 'his'] hand, mounted immediately to the surface of the water, and did not appear again. 
 
“Do not be uncomfortable,” said Captain Nemo. “['It', 'He', 'his', 'he'] is Nicholas of Cape Matapan, surnamed Pesca. ['It', 'He', 'his', 'he'] is well known in all the Cyclades. A bold diver! ['water', 'it'] is ['It', 'He', 'his', 'he'] element, and ['It', 'He', 'his', 'he'] lives more in ['water', 'it'] than on land, going continually from one island to another, even as far as Crete.” 
 
“You know him, Captain?” 
 
“Why not, M. Aronnax?” 
 
Saying which, Captain Nemo went towards ['a piece of furniture standing near the left panel of the saloon', 'this piece of furniture']. Near ['a piece of furniture standing near the left panel of the saloon', 'this piece of furniture'], I saw a chest bound with iron, on the cover of which was ['a copper plate, bearing the cypher of the _Nautilus_ with its devic['a copper plate, bearing the cypher of the _Nautilus_ with its device', 'its'] 'its']. 
 
At that moment, the Captain, without noticing my presence, opened the piece of furniture, a sort of strong box, which held a great many ingots. 
 
They were ingots of ['gold', 'this precious metal, which represented an enormous sum', 'this gold', 'it']. From whence came ['gold', 'this precious metal, which represented an enormous sum', 'this gold', 'it']? Where did ['the Captain', 'he'] gather ['gold', 'this precious metal, which represented an enormous sum', 'this gold', 'it'] from? and what was ['the Captain', 'he'] going to do with ['gold', 'this precious metal, which represented an enormous sum', 'this gold', 'it']? 
 
['I', 'I', 'I'] did not say one word. ['I', 'I', 'I'] looked. ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] took ['the ingots', 'them'] one by one, and arranged ['the ingots', 'them'] methodically in the chest, which ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] filled entirely. ['I', 'I', 'I'] estimated the contents at more than 4,000 lbs. weight of gold, that is to say, nearly £200,000. 
 
The chest was securely fastened, and the Captain wrote an address on the lid, in characters which must have belonged to Modern Greece. 
 
This done, Captain Nemo pressed a knob, the wire of which communicated with the quarters of the crew. ['Four men', 'them'] appeared, and, not without some trouble, pushed ['the chest', 'it'] out of the saloon. Then I heard ['Four men', 'them'] hoisting ['the chest', 'it'] up the iron staircase by means of pulleys. 
 
At that moment, Captain Nemo turned to me. 
 
“And ['you', 'he'] were saying, sir?” said ['you', 'he']. 
 
“I was saying nothing, Captain.” 
 
“Then, ['sir', 'you', 'you'], if ['sir', 'you', 'you'] will allow ['me', 'I'], ['me', 'I'] will wish ['sir', 'you', 'you'] good night.” 
 
Whereupon he turned and left the saloon. 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] returned to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] room much troubled, as one may believe. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] vainly tried to sleep—['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] sought the connecting link between the apparition of the diver and the chest filled with gold. Soon, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] felt by certain movements of pitching and tossing that the _Nautilus_ was leaving the depths and returning to the surface. 
 
Then ['I', 'I'] heard ['steps upon the platform', 'they']; and ['I', 'I'] knew ['steps upon the platform', 'they'] were unfastening ['the pinnace', 'it', 'it'] and launching ['the pinnace', 'it', 'it'] upon the waves. For one instant ['the pinnace', 'it', 'it'] struck the side of the _Nautilus_, then all noise ceased. 
 
Two hours after, the same noise, the same going and coming was renewed; ['the boat', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] was hoisted on board, replaced in ['the boat', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] socket, and ['the boat', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] again plunged under the waves. 
 
So ['these millions', 'their'] had been transported to ['these millions', 'their'] address. To what point of the continent? Who was Captain Nemo’s correspondent? 
 
The next day ['I', 'my', 'My', 'myself'] related to Conseil and the Canadian the events of the night, which had excited ['I', 'my', 'My', 'myself'] curiosity to the highest degree. ['I', 'my', 'My', 'myself'] companions were not less surprised than ['I', 'my', 'My', 'myself']. 
 
“But where does ['he', 'his'] take ['he', 'his'] millions to?” asked Ned Land. 
 
To that there was no possible answer. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] returned to the saloon after having breakfast and set to work. Till five o’clock in the evening ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] employed ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] in arranging ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] notes. At that moment—(ought ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] to attribute it to some peculiar idiosyncrasy)—I felt so great a heat that ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] was obliged to take off ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] coat. It was strange, for we were under low latitudes; and even then ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'], submerged as ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] was, ought to experience no change of temperature. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] looked at ['the manometer', 'it']; ['the manometer', 'it'] showed a depth of sixty feet, to which atmospheric heat could never attain. 
 
['I', 'my'] continued ['I', 'my'] work, but the temperature rose to such a pitch as to be intolerable. 
 
“Could there be fire on board?” ['I', 'myself'] asked ['I', 'myself']. 
 
['I', 'me'] was leaving the saloon, when ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] entered; ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] approached ['the thermometer', 'it'], consulted ['the thermometer', 'it'], and, turning to ['I', 'me'], said: 
 
“Forty-two degrees.” 
 
“['I', 'I'] have noticed ['it', 'it'], Captain,” ['I', 'I'] replied; “and if it gets much hotter we cannot bear ['it', 'it'].” 
 
“Oh, sir, it will not get better if we do not wish it.” 
 
“You can reduce it as you please, then?” 
 
“No; but I can go farther from the stove which produces it.” 
 
“It is outward, then!” 
 
“Certainly; we are floating in a current of boiling water.” 
 
“Is it possible!” I exclaimed. 
 
“Look.” 
 
The panels opened, and ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] saw the sea entirely white all round. A sulphurous smoke was curling amid the waves, which boiled like water in a copper. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] placed ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] hand on ['one of the panes of glass', 'it'], but the heat was so great that ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] quickly took ['one of the panes of glass', 'it'] off again. 
 
“Where are we?” I asked. 
 
“Near the Island of Santorin, ['sir', 'you'],” replied ['the Captain', 'I']. “['the Captain', 'I'] wished to give ['sir', 'you'] a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption.” 
 
“['I', 'I'] thought,” said ['I', 'I'], “that the formation of these new islands was ended.” 
 
“Nothing is ever ended in the volcanic parts of the sea,” replied Captain Nemo; “and the globe is always being worked by subterranean fires. Already, in the nineteenth year of our era, according to ['Cassiodorus and Pliny', 'they'], a new island, Theia (the divine), appeared in the very place where ['these islets', 'they'] have recently been formed. Then ['these islets', 'they'] sank under ['the waves', 'they'], to rise again in the year 69, when ['the waves', 'they'] again subsided. Since that time to our days the Plutonian work has been suspended. But on the 3rd of February, ['1866', 'the same month'], a new island, which ['Cassiodorus and Pliny', 'they'] named George Island, emerged from the midst of the sulphurous vapour near ['Nea Kamenni', 'Nea Kamenni', 'Nea Kamenni'], and settled again the 6th of ['1866', 'the same month']. Seven days after, the 13th of February, ['the Island of Aphroessa', 'itself', 'The Island of Aphroessa, of round form', 'It'] appeared, leaving between ['Nea Kamenni', 'Nea Kamenni', 'Nea Kamenni'] and ['the Island of Aphroessa', 'itself', 'The Island of Aphroessa, of round form', 'It'] a canal ten yards broad. ['I', 'I'] was in these seas when the phenomenon occurred, and ['I', 'I'] was able therefore to observe all the different phases. ['the Island of Aphroessa', 'itself', 'The Island of Aphroessa, of round form', 'It'], measured 300 feet in diameter, and 30 feet in height. ['the Island of Aphroessa', 'itself', 'The Island of Aphroessa, of round form', 'It'] was composed of black and vitreous lava, mixed with fragments of felspar. And lastly, on the 10th of March, ['a smaller island, called Reka', 'itself'], showed ['a smaller island, called Reka', 'itself'] near ['Nea Kamenni', 'Nea Kamenni', 'Nea Kamenni'], and since then these three have joined together, forming but one and the same island.” 
 
“And the canal in which we are at this moment?” I asked. 
 
“Here it is,” replied ['Captain Nemo', 'I'], showing me a map of the Archipelago. “You see, ['Captain Nemo', 'I'] have marked the new islands.” 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] returned to the glass. ['The _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s'] was no longer moving, the heat was becoming unbearable. The sea, which till now had been white, was red, owing to the presence of salts of iron. In spite of ['The _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s'] being hermetically sealed, an insupportable smell of sulphur filled the saloon, and the brilliancy of the electricity was entirely extinguished by bright scarlet flames. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was in a bath, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was choking, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was broiled. 
 
“We can remain no longer in this boiling water,” said I to the Captain. 
 
“It would not be prudent,” replied the impassive Captain Nemo. 
 
An order was given; ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] tacked about and left the furnace ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] could not brave with impunity. A quarter of an hour after ['we', 'our', 'we'] were breathing fresh air on the surface. The thought then struck me that, if Ned Land had chosen this part of ['the sea', 'this sea of fire'] for ['we', 'our', 'we'] flight, ['we', 'our', 'we'] should never have come alive out of ['the sea', 'this sea of fire']. 
 
The next day, the 16th of February, we left the basin which, between Rhodes and Alexandria, is reckoned about 1,500 fathoms in depth, and the _Nautilus_, passing some distance from Cerigo, quitted the Grecian Archipelago after having doubled Cape Matapan. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER VII THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS 
 
The Mediterranean, the blue sea par excellence, “the great sea” of the Hebrews, “the sea” of the Greeks, the “mare nostrum” of the Romans, bordered by orange-trees, aloes, cacti, and sea-pines; embalmed with the perfume of the myrtle, surrounded by rude mountains, saturated with pure and transparent air, but incessantly worked by underground fires; a perfect battlefield in which Neptune and Pluto still dispute the empire of the world! 
 
It is upon these banks, and on these waters, says Michelet, that man is renewed in one of the most powerful climates of the globe. But, beautiful as it was, ['I', 'me', 'I'] could only take a rapid glance at the basin whose superficial area is two million of square yards. Even Captain Nemo’s knowledge was lost to ['I', 'me', 'I'], for this puzzling person did not appear once during ['our', 'we'] passage at full speed. ['I', 'me', 'I'] estimated ['the course which the _Nautilus_ took under the waves of the sea at about six hundred leagues', 'it'], and ['the course which the _Nautilus_ took under the waves of the sea at about six hundred leagues', 'it'] was accomplished in forty-eight hours. Starting on the morning of the 16th of February from the shores of Greece, ['our', 'we'] had crossed the Straits of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th. 
 
It was plain to me that this Mediterranean, enclosed in the midst of those countries which ['he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'his'] wished to avoid, was distasteful to ['he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'his']. Those waves and those breezes brought back too many remembrances, if not too many regrets. Here ['he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'his'] had no longer that independence and that liberty of gait which ['he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'his'] had when in the open seas, and ['he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'hi['his _Nautilus_', 'itself'] felt ['his _Nautilus_', 'itself'] cramped between the close shores of Africa and Europe. 
 
Our speed was now twenty-five miles an hour. It may be well understood that ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'He'], to ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'He'] great disgust, was obliged to renounce ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'He'] intended flight. ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'He'] could not launch the pinnace, going at the rate of twelve or thirteen yards every second. To quit ['the _Nautilus_', 'our vessel', 'its', 'it'] under such conditions would be as bad as jumping from a train going at full speed—an imprudent thing, to say the least of it. Besides, ['the _Nautilus_', 'our vessel', 'its', 'it'] only mounted to the surface of the waves at night to renew ['the _Nautilus_', 'our vessel', 'its', 'it'] stock of air; ['the _Nautilus_', 'our vessel', 'its', 'it'] was steered entirely by the compass and the log. 
 
I saw no more of the interior of this Mediterranean than ['a traveller by express train', 'his'] perceives of the landscape which flies before ['a traveller by express train', 'his'] eyes; that is to say, the distant horizon, and not the nearer objects which pass like a flash of lightning. 
 
We were then passing between Sicily and the coast of Tunis. In the narrow space between Cape Bon and the Straits of Messina the bottom of the sea rose almost suddenly. There was a perfect bank, on which there was not more than nine fathoms of water, whilst on either side the depth was ninety fathoms. 
 
The _Nautilus_ had to manœuvre very carefully so as not to strike against this submarine barrier. 
 
I showed Conseil, on the map of the Mediterranean, the spot occupied by this reef. 
 
“But if ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil'] please, ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil'],” observed ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil'], “it is like a real isthmus joining Europe to Africa.” 
 
“Yes, my boy, ['it', 'Cape Boco'] forms a perfect bar to the Straits of Lybia, and the soundings of Smith have proved that in former times the continents between ['it', 'Cape Boco'] and Cape Furina were joined.” 
 
“['I', 'Conseil'] can well believe it,” said ['I', 'Conseil']. 
 
“['I', 'I'] will add,” ['I', 'I'] continued, “that a similar barrier exists between Gibraltar and Ceuta, which in geological times formed the entire Mediterranean.” 
 
“What if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers above the waves?” 
 
“It is not probable, Conseil.” 
 
“Well, but allow me to finish, please, sir; if this phenomenon should take place, it will be troublesome for M. Lesseps, who has taken so much pains to pierce the isthmus.” 
 
“['I', 'I'] agree with ['you', 'Conseil']; but ['I', 'I'] repeat, ['you', 'Conseil'], this phenomenon will never happen. The violence of subterranean force is ever diminishing. Volcanoes, so plentiful in the first days of ['the world', 'the globe', 'our globe', 'its', 'its'], are being extinguished by degrees; the internal heat is weakened, the temperature of the lower strata of ['the world', 'the globe', 'our globe', 'its', 'its'] is lowered by a perceptible quantity every century to the detriment of ['the world', 'the globe', 'our globe', 'its', 'its'], for ['the world', 'the globe', 'our globe', 'its', 'its'] heat is ['the world', 'the globe', 'our globe', 'its', 'its'] life.” 
 
“But the sun?” 
 
“['The sun', 'it'] is not sufficient, Conseil. Can ['The sun', 'it'] give heat to a dead body?” 
 
“Not that I know of.” 
 
“Well, my friend, ['this earth', 'it'] will one day be that cold corpse; ['this earth', 'it'] will become uninhabitable and uninhabited like ['the moon, which has long since lost all its vital['the moon, which has long since lost all its vital heat', 'its']at', 'its'].” 
 
“In how many centuries?” 
 
“In some hundreds of thousands of years, my boy.” 
 
“Then,” said Conseil, “['we', 'our'] shall have time to finish ['we', 'ou['our journey', 'it']—that is, if Ned Land does not interfere with ['our journey', 'it'].” 
 
And Conseil, reassured, returned to the study of the bank, which the _Nautilus_ was skirting at a moderate speed. 
 
During the night of the 16th and 17th February we had entered the second Mediterranean basin, the greatest depth of which was 1,450 fathoms. ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'itself'], by the action of ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'itself'] crew, slid down the inclined planes and buried ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'itself'] in the lowest depths of the sea. 
 
On the 18th of February, about three o’clock in the morning, ['we', 'we'] were at the entrance of ['the Straits of Gibraltar', 'the Straits of Gibraltar']. There once existed two currents: an upper one, long since recognised, which conveys the waters of the ocean into ['the basin of the Mediterranean', 'the basin ['the Mediterranean', 'the Mediterranean', 'it', 'this sea', 'its', 'the Mediterranean']; and ['a lower counter-current, which reasoning has now shown to exist', 'this counter-current']. Indeed, the volume of water in ['the Mediterranean', 'the Mediterranean', 'it', 'this sea', 'its', 'the Mediterranean'], incessantly added to by the waves of ['the Atlantic', 'the Atlantic', 'the Atlantic'] and by rivers falling into ['the Mediterranean', 'the Mediterranean', 'it', 'this sea', 'its', 'the Mediterranean'], would each year raise the level of ['the Mediterranean', 'the Mediterranean', 'it', 'this sea', 'its', 'the Mediterranean'], for ['the Mediterranean', 'the Mediterranean', 'it', 'this sea', 'its', 'the Mediterranean'] evaporation is not sufficient to restore the equilibrium. As it is not so, we must necessarily admit the existence of an under-current, which empties into ['the basin of the Mediterranean', 'the basin of th['the Atlantic', 'the Atlantic', 'the Atlantic'] through ['the Straits of Gibraltar', 'the Straits of Gibraltar'] the surplus waters of ['the Mediterranean', 'the Mediterranean', 'it', 'this sea', 'its', 'the Mediterranean']. A fact indeed; and it was ['a lower counter-current, which reasoning has now shown to exist', 'this counter-current'] by which ['the _Nautilus_', 'It'] profited. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It'] advanced rapidly by the narrow pass. For one instant I caught a glimpse of the beautiful ruins of ['the temple of Hercules, buried in the ground, according to Pliny, and with the low island which supports it', 'it['the temple of Hercules, buried in the ground, according to Pliny, and with the low island which supports it', 'it']; and a few minutes later ['we', 'we'] were floating on ['the Atlantic', 'the Atlantic', 'the Atlantic']. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER VIII VIGO BAY 
 
The Atlantic! a vast sheet of water whose superficial area covers twenty-five millions of square miles, the length of which is nine thousand miles, with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundred—an ocean whose parallel winding shores embrace an immense circumference, watered by the largest rivers of the world, the St. Lawrence, the Mississippi, the Amazon, the Plata, the Orinoco, the Niger, the Senegal, the Elbe, the Loire, and the Rhine, which carry water from the most civilised, as well as from the most savage, countries! Magnificent field of water, incessantly ploughed by vessels of ['every nation', 'every nation'], sheltered by the flags of ['every nation', 'every nation'], and which terminates in ['those two terrible points so dreaded by mariners', 'those two terrible points so dreaded b['those two terrible points so dreaded by mariners', 'those two terrible points so dreaded by mariners, Cape Horn and the Cape of Tempests']. 
 
['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'It'] was piercing the water with ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'It'] sharp spur, after having accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a distance greater than the great circle of the earth. Where were ['we', 'our', 'us'] going now, and what was reserved for the future? ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'It'], leaving the Straits of Gibraltar, had gone far out. ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'It'] returned to the surface of the waves, and ['we', 'our', 'us'] daily walks on the platform were restored to ['we', 'our', 'us']. 
 
I mounted at once, accompanied by Ned Land and Conseil. At a distance of about twelve miles, Cape St. Vincent was dimly to be seen, forming the south-western point of the Spanish peninsula. A strong southerly gale was blowing. ['The sea', 'it', 'the sea'] was swollen and billowy; ['The sea', 'it', 'the sea'] made the _Nautilus_ rock violently. It was almost impossible to keep one’s foot on the platform, which the heavy rolls of ['The sea', 'it', 'the sea'] beat over every instant. So we descended after inhaling some mouthfuls of fresh air. 
 
['I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me'] returned to ['I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me['my room', 'my room'], ['Conseil', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] to ['Conseil', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] cabin; but ['Conseil', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'], with a preoccupied air, followed ['I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me']. Our rapid passage across the Mediterranean had not allowed ['Conseil', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] to put ['Conseil', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] project into execution, and ['Conseil', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] could not help showing ['Conseil', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] disappointment. When the door of ['I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me['my room', 'my room'] was shut, ['Conseil', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] sat down and looked at ['I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'me'] silently. 
 
“['Friend Ned', 'you', 'you', 'yourself'],” said ['I', 'I'], “['I', 'I'] understand ['Friend Ned', 'you', 'you', 'yourself']; but ['Friend Ned', 'you', 'you', 'yourself'] cannot reproach ['Friend Ned', 'you', 'you', 'yourself']. To have attempted to leave the _Nautilus_ under the circumstances would have been folly.” 
 
['Ned Land', 'his', 'him', 'his'] did not answer; ['Ned Land', 'his', 'him', 'his'] compressed lips and frowning brow showed with ['Ned Land', 'his', 'him', 'his'] the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of ['Ned Land', 'his', 'him', 'his'] mind. 
 
“Let ['us', 'we', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'we'] see,” ['I', 'I', 'I'] continued; “['us', 'we', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'we'] need not despair yet. ['us', 'we', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'we'] are going up the coast of Portugal again; France and England are not far off, where ['us', 'we', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'we'] can easily find refuge. Now if ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'], on leaving the Straits of Gibraltar, had gone to the south, if ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] had carried ['us', 'we', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'we'] towards regions where there were no continents, ['I', 'I', 'I'] should share ['your', 'you'] uneasiness. But ['us', 'we', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'we'] know now that Captain Nemo does not fly from civilised seas, and in some days ['I', 'I', 'I'] think ['your', 'you'] can act with security.” 
 
['Ned Land', 'his', 'he'] still looked at me fixedly; at length ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he'] fixed lips parted, and ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he'] said, “It is for to-night.” 
 
['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I'] drew ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I'] up suddenly. ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was, ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I'] admit, little prepared for this communication. ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I'] wanted to answer the Canadian, but words would not come. 
 
“['We', 'we'] agreed to wait for ['an opportunity', 'the opportunity'],” continued ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I'], “and ['an opportunity', 'the opportunity'] has arrived. This night ['We', 'we'] shall be but a few miles from the Spanish coast. It is cloudy. The wind blows freely. ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I'] have ['your', 'M. Aronnax', 'you'] word, ['your', 'M. Aronnax', 'you'], and ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I'] rely upon ['your', 'M. Aronnax', 'you'].” 
 
As ['I', 'me'] was silent, the Canadian approached ['I', 'me']. 
 
“['To-night', 'to-night'], at nine o’clock,” said ['he', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I']. “['he', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] have warned ['Conseil', 'Conseil']. At that moment ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] will be shut up in ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] room, probably in bed. Neither the engineers nor ['the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_'] crew can see ['us', 'Conseil and I', 'us']. ['Conseil', 'Co['us', 'Conseil and I', 'us'['he', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] will gain the central staircase, and you, M. Aronnax, will remain in the library, two steps from ['us', 'Conseil and I', 'us'], waiting ['he', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] signal. The oars, the mast, and the sail are in the canoe. ['he', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] have even succeeded in getting some provisions. ['he', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] have procured ['an English wrench', 'it'], to unfasten the bolts which attach ['an English wrench', 'it'] to the shell of ['the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus', 'the['the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_']. So all is ready, till ['To-night', 'to-night'].” 
 
“The sea is bad.” 
 
“['That', 'that'] ['I', 'the Canadian'] allow,” replied ['I', 'the Canadian']; “but ['we', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we'] must risk ['That', 'that']. Liberty is worth paying for; besides, the boat is strong, and a few miles with a fair wind to carry ['we', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we'] is no great thing. Who knows but by to-morrow ['we', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we'] may be a hundred leagues away? Let circumstances only favour ['we', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we'], and by ten or eleven o’clock ['we', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we'] shall have landed on some spot of terra firma, alive or dead. But adieu now till to-night.” 
 
With these words the Canadian withdrew, leaving ['me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'myself', 'my'] almost dumb. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'myself', 'my'] had imagined that, the chance gone, ['me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'myself', 'my'] should have time to reflect and discuss the matter. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'myself', 'my['My obstinate companion', 'him', 'Ned Land'] had given ['me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'myself', 'my'] no time; and, after all, what could ['me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'myself', 'my'] have said to ['My obstinate companion', 'him', 'Ned Land']? ['My obstinate companion', 'him', 'Ned Land'] was perfectly right. There was almost the opportunity to profit by. Could ['me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'myself', 'my'] retract ['me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'myself', 'my'] word, and take upon ['me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'myself', 'my'] the responsibility of compromising the future of ['me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'myself', 'my'] companions? To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from all land. 
 
At that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs were filling, and that the _Nautilus_ was sinking under the waves of the Atlantic. 
 
A sad day ['I', 'my', 'my'] passed, between the desire of regaining ['I', 'my', 'my'] liberty of action and of abandoning the wonderful _Nautilus_, and leaving ['I', 'my', 'my'] submarine studies incomplete. 
 
What dreadful hours ['I', 'myself', 'my'] passed thus! Sometimes seeing ['I', 'myself', 'my'] and companions safely landed, sometimes wishing, in spite of ['I', 'myself', 'my'] reason, that some unforeseen circumstance, would prevent the realisation of Ned Land’s project. 
 
Twice ['I', 'I', 'I'] went to the saloon. ['I', 'I', 'I'] wished to consult the compass. ['I', 'I', 'I'] wished to see if the direction ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] was taking was bringing ['us', 'us'] nearer or taking ['us', 'us'] farther from the coast. But no; ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] kept in Portuguese waters. 
 
['I', 'my', 'My', 'my'] must therefore take ['I', 'my', 'My', 'my'] part and prepare for flight. ['I', 'my', 'My', 'my'] luggage was not heavy; ['I', 'my', 'My', 'my'] notes, nothing more. 
 
As to ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'him', 'he'], ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] asked ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] what ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'him', 'he'] would think of ['our escape', 'i['our', 'us', 'our', 'us'] 'its']; what trouble, what wrong ['our escape', 'it', 'its'] might cause ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'him', 'he'] and what ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'him', 'he'] might do in case of ['our escape', 'it', 'its'] discovery or failure. Certainly ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] had no cause to complain of ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'him', 'he']; on the contrary, never was hospitality freer than ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'him', 'he']. In leaving ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'him', 'he'] ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] could not be taxed with ingratitude. No oath bound ['our', 'us', 'our', 'us'] to ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'him', 'he']. It was on the strength of circumstances ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'him', 'he'] relied, and not upon ['our', 'us', 'our', 'us'] word, to fix ['our', 'us', 'our', 'us'] for ever. 
 
['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine', 'my', 'I', 'my'] had not seen ['the Captain', 'his', 'him'] since ['our', 'our'] visit to the Island of Santorin. Would ['chance', 'it', 'it'] bring ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine', 'my', 'I', 'my'] to ['the Captain', 'his', 'him'] presence before ['our', 'our'] departure? ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine', 'my', 'I', 'my'] wished ['chance', 'it', 'it'], and ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine', 'my', 'I', 'my'] feared ['chance', 'it', 'it'] at the same time. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine', 'my', 'I', 'my'] listened if ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine', 'my', 'I', 'my'] could hear ['the Captain', 'his', 'him'] walking the room contiguous to ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine', 'my', 'I', 'my']. No sound reached ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine', 'my', 'I', 'my'] ear. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine', 'my', 'I', 'my'] felt an unbearable uneasiness. This day of waiting seemed eternal. Hours struck too slowly to keep pace with ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine', 'my', 'I', 'my'] impatience. 
 
['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] dinner was served in ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] room as usual. ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] ate but little; ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] was too preoccupied. ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] left the table at seven o’clock. A hundred and twenty minutes (['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] counted them) still separated ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] from the moment in which ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] was to join Ned Land. ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] agitation redoubled. ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] pulse beat violently. ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] could not remain quiet. ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] went and came, hoping to calm ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] troubled spirit by constant movement. The idea of failure in ['our', 'ou['our bold enterprise', 'our project'] was the least painful of ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] anxieties; but the thought of seeing ['our', 'ou['our bold enterprise', 'our project'] discovered before leaving the _Nautilus_, of being brought before Captain Nemo, irritated, or (what was worse) saddened, at ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] desertion, made ['My', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] heart beat. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] wanted to see the saloon for the last time. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] descended the stairs and arrived in ['the museum, where I had passed so ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I']any useful and agreeable hours', 'its', 'its']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] looked at all ['the museum, where I had passed so many useful and agreeable hours', 'its', 'its'] riches, all ['the museum, where I had passed so many useful and agreeable hours', 'its', 'its'] treasures, like a man on the eve of an eternal exile, who was leaving never to return. 
 
['These wonders of Nature, these masterpieces of art, amongst which for so many days my life ha['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I']been concentrated', 'them'], ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] was going to abandon ['These wonders of Nature, these masterpieces of art, amongst which for so many days my life had been concentrated', 'them'] for ever! ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] should like to have taken a last look through the windows of the saloon into the waters of ['the Atlantic', 'that ocean which I had not yet explored']: but the panels were hermetically closed, and a cloak of steel separated ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] from ['the Atlantic', 'that ocean which I ['my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I']ad not yet explored']. 
 
In passing through the saloon, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] came near ['the door let into the angle which opened into the Captain’s room', 'this ['the Captain’s', 'Captain Nemo',['the Captain’s room', 'his room', 'The room']. To ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] great surprise, ['the door let into the angle which opened into the Captain’s room', 'this door', 'the door'] was ajar. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] drew back involuntarily. If ['the Captain’s', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he'] should be in ['the Captain’s', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'h['the Captain’s room', 'his room', 'The room'], ['the Captain’s', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he'] could see ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I']. But, hearing no sound, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] drew nearer. ['the Captain’s room', 'his room', 'The room'] was deserted. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I'] pushed open ['the door let into the angle which opened into the Captain’s room', 'this door', 'the door'] and took some steps forward. Still the same monklike severity of aspect. 
 
Suddenly the clock struck eight. The first beat of the hammer on the bell awoke ['me', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I'] from ['me', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I'] dreams. ['me', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I'] trembled as if an invisible eye had plunged into ['me', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I'] most secret thoughts, and ['me', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I'] hurried from the room. 
 
There my eye fell upon the compass. Our course was still north. The log indicated moderate speed, the manometer a depth of about sixty feet. 
 
['I', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] returned to ['I', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] room, clothed ['I', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] warmly—sea boots, an otterskin cap, a great coat of byssus, lined with sealskin; ['I', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] was ready, ['I', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] was waiting. The vibration of the screw alone broke the deep silence which reigned on board. ['I', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] listened attentively. Would no loud voice suddenly inform ['I', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] that ['Ned Land', 'his'] had been surprised in ['Ned Land', 'his'] projected flight. A mortal dread hung over ['I', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'], and ['I', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] vainly tried to regain ['I', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] accustomed coolness. 
 
At a few minutes to nine, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] put ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] ear to the Captain’s door. No noise. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] left ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] room and returned to the saloon, which was half in obscurity, but deserted. 
 
['I', 'I', 'myself'] opened ['the door communicating with the library', 'the door leading to the central staircase']. The same insufficient light, the same solitude. ['I', 'I', 'myself'] placed ['I', 'I', 'myself'] near ['the door communicating with the library', 'the door leading to the central staircase'], and there waited for Ned Land’s signal. 
 
At that moment ['the trembling of the screw', 'it'] sensibly diminished, then ['the trembling of the screw', 'it'] stopped entirely. The silence was now only disturbed by the beatings of ['my', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I'] own heart. Suddenly a slight shock was felt; and ['my', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I'] knew that the _Nautilus_ had stopped at the bottom of the ocean. ['my', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I'] uneasiness increased. The Canadian’s signal did not come. ['my', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I'] felt inclined to join ['Ned Land', 'him', 'his'] and beg of ['Ned Land', 'him', 'his'] to put off ['Ned Land', 'him', 'his'] attempt. ['my', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I'] felt that ['we', 'our'] were not sailing under ['we', 'our'] usual conditions. 
 
At this moment the door of the large saloon opened, and ['Captain Nemo', 'He'] appeared. ['Captain Nemo', 'He'] saw me, and without further preamble began in an amiable tone of voice: 
 
“Ah, ['sir', 'you', 'you']! I have been looking for ['sir', 'you', 'you']. Do ['sir', 'you', 'you'] know the history of Spain?” 
 
Now, one might know ['the history of one’s own country', 'it'] by heart; but in the condition ['I', 'I'] was at the time, with troubled mind and head quite lost, ['I', 'I'] could not have said a word of ['the history of one’s own country', 'it']. 
 
“Well,” continued ['Captain Nemo', 'my'], “['you', 'you'] heard ['Captain Nemo', 'my'] question! Do ['you', 'you'] know the history of Spain?” 
 
“Very slightly,” I answered. 
 
“Well, here are learned men having to learn,” said ['the Captain', 'I', 'he']. “Come, sit down, and ['the Captain', 'I', 'he'] will tell ['you', 'Sir', 'you', 'you'] a curious episode in ['this history', 'this history', 'it']. ['you', 'Sir', 'you', 'you'], listen well,” said ['the Captain', 'I', 'he']; “['this history', 'this history', 'it'] will interest ['you', 'Sir', 'you', 'you'] on one side, for ['this history', 'this history', 'it'] will answer a question which doubtless ['you', 'Sir', 'you', 'you'] have not been able to solve.” 
 
“['I', 'I', 'my', 'myself'] listen, Captain,” said ['I', 'I', 'my', 'myself'], not knowing what ['I', 'I', 'my', 'myself'] interlocutor was driving at, and asking ['I', 'I', 'my', 'myself'] if this incident was bearing on our projected flight. 
 
“['Sir', 'you', 'You', 'your'], if ['Sir', 'you', 'You', 'your'] have no objection, we will go back to 1702. ['Sir', 'you', 'You', 'your'] cannot be ignorant that ['Sir', 'you', 'You', 'yo['your king, Louis XIV', 'his', 'his'], thinking that the gesture of a potentate was sufficient to bring the Pyrenees under ['your king, Louis XIV', 'his', 'his'] yoke, had imposed ['the Duke of Anjou, his grandson', 'This pri['your king, Louis XIV', 'his', 'his']', 'him'], on the Spaniards. ['the Duke of Anjou, his grandson', 'This prince', 'him'] reigned more or less badly under the name of ['Philip V', 'Philip V'], and had a strong party against ['the Duke of Anjou, his grandson', 'This prince', 'him'] abroad. Indeed, the preceding year, ['the royal houses of Holland, Austria, and England', 'they'] had concluded a treaty of alliance at the Hague, with the intention of plucking ['the crown of Spain', 'it'] from the head of ['Philip V', 'Philip V'], and placing ['the crown of Spain', 'it'] on that of an archduke to whom ['the royal houses of Holland, Austria, and England', 'they'] prematurely gave the title of Charles III. 
 
“['Spain', 'she', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'they'] must resist ['this coalition', 'the coalition']; but ['Spain', 'she', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'they'] was almost entirely unprovided with either soldiers or sailors. However, money would not fail ['Spain', 'she', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'they'], provided that ['Spain', 'she', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'they'] galleons, laden with gold and silver from America, once entered ['Spain', 'she', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'they'] ports. And about the end of 1702 ['Spain', 'she', 'them', 'their', 'their', 'they'] expected ['a rich convoy which France was escorting with a fleet of twenty-three vessels, commanded by Admiral Chateau-R['Admiral Chateau-Renaud', 'the Admiral'], for the ships of ['this coalition', 'the coalition'] were already beating the Atlantic. ['a rich convoy which France was escorting with a fleet of twenty-three vessels, commanded by Admiral Chateau-Renaud', 'This convoy'] was to go to Cadiz, but ['Admiral Chateau-Renaud', 'the Admiral'], hearing that an English fleet was cruising in those waters, resolved to make for a French port. 
 
“['The Spanish commanders of the convoy', 'They'] objected to this decision. ['The Spanish commanders of the convoy', 'They'] wanted to be taken to a Spanish port, and, if not to Cadiz, into Vigo Bay, situated on the northwest coast of Spain, and which was not blocked. 
 
“Admiral Chateau-Renaud had the rashness to obey this injunction, and the galleons entered Vigo Bay. 
 
“Unfortunately, it formed an open road which could not be defended in any way. ['They', 'them'] must therefore hasten to unload the galleons before the arrival of the combined fleet; and time would not have failed ['They', 'them'] had not a miserable question of rivalry suddenly arisen. 
 
“You are following the chain of events?” asked Captain Nemo. 
 
“Perfectly,” said I, not knowing the end proposed by this historical lesson. 
 
“I will continue. This is what passed. ['The merchants of Cadiz', 'they', 'them', 'their', 'They'] had a privilege by which ['The merchants of Cadiz', 'they', 'them', 'their', 'They'] had the right of receiving all merchandise coming from the West Indies. Now, to disembark these ingots at the port of ['Vigo', 'Vigo'] was depriving ['The merchants of Cadiz', 'they', 'them', 'their', 'They'] of ['The merchants of Cadiz', 'they', 'them', 'their', 'They'] rights. ['The merchants of Cadiz', 'they', 'them', 'their', 'They'] complained at Madrid, and obtained the consent of the weak-minded Philip that ['the convoy', 'its'], without discharging ['the convoy', 'its'] cargo, should remain sequestered in the roads of ['Vigo', 'Vigo'] until the enemy had disappeared. 
 
“But whilst coming to this decision, on the 22nd of October, 1702, the English vessels arrived in Vigo Bay, when ['Admiral Chateau-Renaud', 'he'], in spite of inferior forces, fought bravely. But, seeing that the treasure must fall into the enemy’s hands, ['Admiral Chateau-Renaud', 'he'] burnt and scuttled ['every galleon, which went to the bottom with their immen['every galleon, which went to the bottom with their immense riches', 'their']ches', 'their'].” 
 
Captain Nemo stopped. ['I', 'I', 'me'] admit ['I', 'I', 'me'] could not see yet why this history should interest ['I', 'I', 'me']. 
 
“Well?” I asked. 
 
“Well, ['M. Aronnax', 'yourself', 'you'],” replied Captain Nemo, “we are in ['that Vigo Bay', 'its']; and it rests with ['M. Aronnax', 'yourself', 'you'] whether ['M. Aronnax', 'yourself', 'you'] will penetrate ['that Vigo Bay', 'its'] mysteries.” 
 
['The Captain', 'him'] rose, telling ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] to follow ['The Captain', 'him']. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] had had time to recover. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] obeyed. The saloon was dark, but through the transparent glass the waves were sparkling. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] looked. 
 
For half a mile around ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_'], the waters seemed bathed in electric light. The sandy bottom was clean and bright. ['Some of the ship’s ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_']eir divin['Some of the ship’s crew in their diving-dresses', 'their']sses', 'their'] were clearing away ['half-rotten barrels and empty cases', 'these cases', 'these barrels'] from the midst of the blackened wrecks. From ['half-rotten barrels and empty cases', 'these cases', 'these barrels'] and from ['half-rotten barrels and empty cases', 'these cases', 'these barrels'] escaped ['ingots of gold and silver, cascades of piastres and jewels', 'them']. The sand was heaped up with ['ingots of gold and silver, cascades of piastres and jewels', 'them']. Laden with ['their', 'the men', 'their'] precious booty, ['their', 'the men', 'their'] returned to ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_'], disposed of ['their', 'the men', 'their'] burden, and went back to this inexhaustible fishery of gold and silver. 
 
I understood now. ['This', 'this very spot'] was the scene of the battle of the 22nd of October, 1702. Here on ['This', 'this very spot'] the galleons laden for the Spanish Government had sunk. Here ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He'] came, according to ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He'] wants, to pack up those millions with which ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He'] burdened the _Nautilus_. It was for ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He'] and him alone ['America', 'her'] had given up ['America', 'he['her precious metals', 'those treasures torn from the Incas and from the conquered of Ferdinand Cortez']. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He'] was heir direct, without anyone to share, in ['her precious metals', 'those treasures torn from the Incas and from the conquered of Ferdinand Cortez']. 
 
“Did ['you', 'sir', 'he'] know, ['you', 'sir', 'he'],” ['you', 'sir', 'he'] asked, smiling, “that the sea contained such riches?” 
 
“['I', 'I'] knew,” ['I', 'I'] answered, “that they value money held in suspension in these waters at two millions.” 
 
“Doubtless; but to extract ['this money', 'the millions I am worth'] the expense would be greater than the profit. Here, on the contrary, ['I', 'my', 'I'] have but to pick up what man has lost—and not only in Vigo Bay, but in a thousand other ports where shipwrecks have happened, and which are marked on ['I', 'my', 'I'] submarine map. Can you understand now the source of ['this money', 'the millions I ['I', 'my', 'I']m worth']?” 
 
“['I', 'me'] understand, ['Captain', 'you', 'you']. But allow ['I', 'me'] to tell ['Captain', 'you', 'you'] that in exploring Vigo Bay ['Captain', 'you', 'you'] have only been beforehand with a rival society.” 
 
“And which?” 
 
“A society which has received from the Spanish Government the privilege of seeking ['those buried galleons', 'these rich shipwrecks']. ['The shareholders', 'they'] are led on by the allurement of an enormous bounty, for ['The shareholders', 'they'] value ['those buried galleons', 'these rich shipwrecks'] at five hundred millions.” 
 
“Five hundred millions ['they', 'they'] were,” answered Captain Nemo, “but ['they', 'they'] are so no longer.” 
 
“Just so,” said ['I', 'I']; “and a warning to ['those shareholders', 'them', 'them', 'they'] would be ['an act of charity', 'it']. But who knows if ['an act of charity', 'it'] would be well received? What ['gamblers', 'their', 'their'] usually regret above all is less the loss of ['gamblers', 'their', 'their'] money than of ['gamblers', 'their', 'their'] foolish hopes. After all, ['I', 'I'] pity ['those shareholders', 'them', 'them', 'they'] less than the thousands of unfortunates to whom so much riches well-distributed would have been profitable, whilst for ['those shareholders', 'them', 'them', 'they'] ['those shareholders', 'them', 'them', 'they'] will be for ever barren.” 
 
['I', 'I'] had no sooner expressed ['this regret', 'it'] than ['I', 'I'] felt that ['this regret', 'it'] must have wounded Captain Nemo. 
 
“['Barren', 'you', 'sir', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you']!” ['he', 'I', 'myself', 'myself alone', 'I', 'I', 'I'] exclaimed, with animation. “Do ['Barren', 'you', 'sir', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you'] think then, ['Barren', 'you', 'sir', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you'], that ['these riches', 'them', 'these treasures'] are lost because ['he', 'I', 'myself', 'myself alone', 'I', 'I', 'I'] gather ['these riches', 'them', 'these treasures']? Is it for ['he', 'I', 'myself', 'myself alone', 'I', 'I'['he', 'I', 'myself', 'myself alone', 'I', 'I', 'I'], according to ['Barren', 'you', 'sir', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you'] idea, that ['he', 'I', 'myself', 'myself alone', 'I', 'I', 'I'] take the trouble to collect ['these riches', 'them', 'these treasures']? Who told ['Barren', 'you', 'sir', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you'] that ['he', 'I', 'myself', 'myself alone', 'I', 'I', 'I'] did not make a good use of it? Do ['Barren', 'you', 'sir', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you'] think ['he', 'I', 'myself', 'myself alone', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am ignorant that there are suffering beings and oppressed races on this earth, miserable creatures to console, victims to avenge? Do ['Barren', 'you', 'sir', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you'] not understand?” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] stopped at these last words, regretting perhaps that ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] had spoken so much. But ['I', 'I'] had guessed that, whatever ['the motive which had forced him to s['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] independence under the sea', 'it'], ['the motive which had forced him to seek independence under the sea', 'it'] had left ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] still a man, that ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity, and that ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] immense charity was for oppressed races as well as individuals. And ['I', 'I'] then understood for whom those millions were destined which were forwarded by ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] when the _Nautilus_ was cruising in the waters of Crete. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER IX A VANISHED CONTINENT 
 
The next morning, the 19th of February, ['I', 'my', 'I'] saw ['the Canadian', 'He'] enter ['I', 'my', 'I'] room. ['I', 'my', 'I'] expected this visit. ['the Canadian', 'He'] looked very disappointed. 
 
“Well, sir?” said he. 
 
“Well, Ned, fortune was against us yesterday.” 
 
“Yes; ['that Captain', 'his'] must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended leaving ['that Captain', 'his'] vessel.” 
 
“Yes, Ned, ['he', 'his'] had business at ['he', 'his'] bankers.” 
 
“His bankers!” 
 
“Or rather ['his bankin['his', 'his']ouse', 'that']; by ['his banking-house', 'that'] I mean the ocean, where ['his', 'his'] riches are safer than in the chests of the State.” 
 
['I', 'my'] then related to ['the Canadian', 'him'] the incidents of the preceding night, hoping to bring ['the Canadian', 'him'] back to the idea of not abandoning the Captain; but ['I', 'my'] recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret from ['Ned', 'he', 'his'] that ['Ned', 'he', 'his'] had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of Vigo on ['Ned', 'he', 'his'] own account. 
 
“However,” said he, “all is not ended. It is only a blow of the harpoon lost. Another time we must succeed; and to-night, if necessary——” 
 
“In what direction is the _Nautilus_ going?” I asked. 
 
“['I', 'Ned'] do not know,” replied ['I', 'Ned']. 
 
“Well, at noon we shall see the point.” 
 
The Canadian returned to Conseil. As soon as ['I', 'I'] was dressed, ['I', 'I'] went into the saloon. The compass was not reassuring. The course of the _Nautilus_ was S.S.W. ['We', 'our'] were turning ['We', 'our'] backs on Europe. 
 
['I', 'I', 'me'] waited with some impatience till ['the ship’s', 'our vessel'] place was pricked on the chart. At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied, and ['the ship’s', 'our vessel'] rose to the surface of the ocean. ['I', 'I', 'me'] rushed towards the platform. ['Ned Land', 'Ned', 'He', 'he'] had preceded ['I', 'I', 'me']. No more land in sight. Nothing but an immense sea. Some sails on ['the horizon', 'the cloudy horizon'], doubtless those going to San Roque in search of favourable winds for doubling the Cape of Good Hope. The weather was cloudy. A gale of wind was preparing. ['Ned Land', 'Ned', 'He', 'he'] raved, and tried to pierce ['the horizon', 'the cloudy horizon']. ['Ned Land', 'Ned', 'He', 'he'] still hoped that behind all that fog stretched the land ['Ned Land', 'Ned', 'He', 'he'] so longed for. 
 
At noon ['the sun', 'itself'] showed ['the sun', 'itself'] for an instant. ['The second', 'its'] profited by this brightness to take ['The second', 'its'] height. Then, the sea becoming more billowy, we descended, and the panel closed. 
 
An hour after, upon consulting the chart, ['I', 'I', 'I'] saw the position of the _Nautilus_ was marked at 16° 17′ long., and 33° 22′ lat., at 150 leagues from the nearest coast. There was no means of flight, and ['I', 'I', 'I'] leave you to imagine the rage of ['the Canadian', 'him'] when ['I', 'I', 'I'] informed ['the Canadian', 'him'] of our situation. 
 
For ['myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'], ['myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] was not particularly sorry. ['myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] felt lightened of the load which had oppressed ['myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'], and was able to return with some degree of calmness to ['myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] accustomed work. 
 
That night, about eleven o’clock, ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] received a most unexpected visit from ['Captain Nemo', 'He']. ['Captain Nemo', 'He'] asked ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] very graciously if ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] felt fatigued from ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] watch of the preceding night. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I'] answered in the negative. 
 
“Then, M. Aronnax, I propose a curious excursion.” 
 
“Propose, Captain?” 
 
“['You', 'you'] have hitherto only visited ['the submarine depths', 'them'] by daylight, under the brightness of the sun. Would it suit ['You', 'you'] to see ['the submarine depths', 'them'] in the darkness of the night?” 
 
“Most willingly.” 
 
“I warn you, the way will be tiring. We shall have far to walk, and must climb a mountain. The roads are not well kept.” 
 
“What ['you', 'Captain', 'you'] say, ['you', 'Captain', 'you'], only heightens ['my', 'I'] curiosity; ['my', 'I'] am ready to follow ['you', 'Captain', 'you'].” 
 
“Come then, sir, ['we', 'our'] will put on ['we', 'our'] diving-dresses.” 
 
Arrived at the robing-room, ['I', 'my', 'my', 'me'] saw that neither of ['I', 'my', 'my', 'me'] companions nor any of the ship’s crew were to follow us on this excursion. Captain Nemo had not even proposed ['I', 'my', 'my', 'me'] taking with ['I', 'my', 'my', 'me'] either Ned or Conseil. 
 
In a few moments ['we', 'our', 'our'] had put on ['we', 'our', 'ou['our diving-dresses', 'they']; ['our diving-dresses', 'they'] placed on ['we', 'our', 'our'] backs the reservoirs, abundantly filled with air, but no electric lamps were prepared. I called the Captain’s attention to the fact. 
 
“They will be useless,” he replied. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] thought ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] had not heard aright, but ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] could not repeat ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] observation, for ['the Captain’s head', 'its'] had already disappeared in ['the Captain’s head', 'its'] metal case. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] finished harnessing ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] felt them put an iron-pointed stick into ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] hand, and some minutes later, after going through the usual form, ['we', 'our'] set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic at a depth of 150 fathoms. Midnight was near. The waters were profoundly dark, but Captain Nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot, ['a sort of large light', 'this fire', 'it', 'it', 'it'] shining brilliantly about two miles from the _Nautilus_. What ['a sort of large light', 'this fire', 'it', 'it', 'it'] might be, what could feed ['a sort of large light', 'this fire', 'it', 'it', 'it'], why and how ['a sort of large light', 'this fire', 'it', 'it', 'it'] lit up the liquid mass, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] could not say. In any case, ['a sort of large light', 'this fire', 'it', 'it', 'it'] did light ['we', 'our'] way, vaguely, it is true, but ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] soon accustomed ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] to the peculiar darkness, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] understood, under such circumstances, the uselessness of the Ruhmkorff apparatus. 
 
As we advanced, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] heard ['a kind of pattering above my head', 'The ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I']ise']. ['a kind of pattering above my head', 'The noise'] redoubling, sometimes producing a continual shower, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] soon understood the cause. It was rain falling violently, and crisping the surface of the waves. Instinctively the thought flashed across ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] mind that ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] should be wet through! By ['the water', 'the water']! in the midst of ['the water', 'the water']! ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] could not help laughing at the odd idea. But, indeed, in the thick diving-dress, the liquid element is no longer felt, and one only seems to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere. Nothing more. 
 
After half an hour’s walk ['the soil', 'it'] became stony. ['Medusae, microscopic crustacea, and pennatules', 'their'] lit ['the soil', 'it'] slightly with ['Medusae, microscopic crustacea, and pennatules', 'their'] phosphorescent gleam. ['I', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'I'] caught a glimpse of ['pieces of stone covered with millions of zoophytes and masses of sea weed', 'this sticky carpet of sea weed']. ['I', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'I'] feet often slipped upon ['pieces of stone covered with millions of zoophytes and masses of sea weed', 'this sticky carpet of sea weed'], and without ['I', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'I'] iron-tipped stick ['I', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'I'] should have fallen more than once. In turning round, ['I', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'I'] could still see the whitish lantern of the _Nautilus_ beginning to pale in the distance. 
 
But the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon. The presence of ['this fire', 'this flame'] under water puzzled ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] in the highest degree. Was ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the _savants_ of ['the earth', 'this earth']? Or even (for this thought crossed ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] brain) had the hand of ['man', 'he'] aught to do with this conflagration? Had ['man', 'he'] fanned ['this fire', 'this flame']? Was ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] to meet in these depths companions and friends of ['Captain Nemo wh['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo']ing to['Captain Nemo whom he was going to visit', 'he', 'him']isit', 'he', 'him'], and who, like ['Captain Nemo whom he was going to visit', 'he', 'him'], led this strange existence? Should ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] find down there a whole colony of exiles who, weary of the miseries of ['the earth', 'this earth'], had sought and found independence in the deep ocean? All these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I']. And in this condition of mind, over-excited by the succession of wonders continually passing before ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] eyes, ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] should not have been surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns of which ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] dreamed. 
 
Our road grew lighter and lighter. ['The white glimmer', 'this inexplicable light'] came in rays from the summit of ['a mountain about 800 feet high', 'the mountain']. But what I saw was simply a reflection, developed by the clearness of the waters. The source of ['The white glimmer', 'this inexplicable light'] was a fire on the opposite side of ['a mountain about 800 feet high', 'the mountain']. 
 
In the midst of ['this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic', 'this dreary road', 'it'], ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his'] advanced without hesitation. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his'] knew ['this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic', 'this dreary road', 'it']. Doubtless ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his'] had often travelled over ['this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic', 'this dreary road', 'it'], and could not lose ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his']. ['I', 'me', 'me', 'I'] followed ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his'] with unshaken confidence. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his'] seemed to ['I', 'me', 'me', 'I'] like a genie of the sea; and, as ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his'] walked before ['I', 'me', 'me', 'I'], ['I', 'me', 'me', 'I'] could not help admiring ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'himself', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his'] stature, which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon. 
 
It was one in the morning when ['we', 'we'] arrived at ['the first slopes of the mountain', 'them']; but to gain access to ['the first slopes of the mountain', 'them'] ['we', 'we'] must venture through the difficult paths of a vast copse. 
 
Yes; a copse of dead trees, without leaves, without sap, trees petrified by the action of the water and here and there overtopped by gigantic pines. It was like a coal-pit still standing, holding by the roots to the broken soil, and whose branches, like fine black paper cuttings, showed distinctly on the watery ceiling. Picture to yourself a forest in the Hartz hanging on to the sides of the mountain, but a forest swallowed up. The paths were encumbered with seaweed and fucus, between which grovelled a whole world of crustacea. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] went along, climbing the rocks, striding over extended trunks, breaking the sea bind-weed which hung from one tree to the other; and frightening the fishes, which flew from branch to branch. Pressing onward, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] felt no fatigue. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] followed ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] guide, who was never tired. What a spectacle! How can ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] express it? how paint the aspect of ['those woods and rocks in this medium', 'their']—['those woods and rocks in this medium', 'their'] under parts dark and wild, the upper coloured with red tints, by that light which the reflecting powers of the waters doubled? We climbed rocks which fell directly after with gigantic bounds and the low growling of an avalanche. To right and left ran ['long, dark galleries, where sight was lost', 'these submarine regions']. Here opened vast glades which the hand of man seemed to have worked; and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] sometimes asked ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] if some inhabitant of ['long, dark galleries, where sight was lost', 'these submarine regions'] would not suddenly appear to ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'me']. 
 
But Captain Nemo was still mounting. ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] could not stay behind. ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] followed boldly. ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] stick gave ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] good help. A false step would have been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the gulfs; but ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] walked with firm step, without feeling any giddiness. Now ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] jumped ['a crevice, the depth of which would have made me hesit['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my']e had it been ['a crevice, the depth of which would have made me hesitate had it been among the glaciers on the land', 'it']ong the glaciers on the land', 'it']; now ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] ventured on the unsteady trunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other, without looking under ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] feet, having only eyes to admire the wild sites of this region. 
 
There, ['monumental rocks', 'their', 'their', 'trees', 'them'], leaning on ['monumental rocks', 'their', 'their', 'trees', 'them'] regularly-cut bases, seemed to defy all laws of equilibrium. From between ['monumental rocks', 'their', 'their', 'trees', 'them'] stony knees ['monumental rocks', 'their', 'their', 'trees', 'them'] sprang, like a jet under heavy pressure, and upheld others which upheld ['monumental rocks', 'their', 'their', 'trees', 'them']. Natural towers, large scarps, cut perpendicularly, like a “curtain,” inclined at an angle which the laws of gravitation could never have tolerated in terrestrial regions. 
 
Two hours after quitting the _Nautilus_ ['we', 'our', 'our'] had crossed the line of trees, and a hundred feet above ['we', 'our', 'our'] heads rose the top of the mountain, which cast a shadow on the brilliant irradiation of the opposite slope. Some petrified shrubs ran fantastically here and there. Fishes got up under ['we', 'our', 'our'] feet like birds in the long grass. The massive rocks were rent with impenetrable fractures, deep grottos, and unfathomable holes, at the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving. ['My', 'I', 'my'] blood curdled when ['My', 'I', 'my'] saw enormous antennae blocking ['My', 'I', 'my'] road, or some frightful claw closing with a noise in the shadow of some cavity. ['Millions of luminous spots', 'They'] shone brightly in the midst of the darkness. ['Millions of luminous spots', 'They'] were the eyes of ['giant crustacea crouched in their holes['giant crustacea crouched in their holes', 'their']heir']; ['giant lobsters', 'themselves', 'their'] setting ['giant lobsters', 'themselves', 'their'] up like halberdiers, and moving ['giant lobsters', 'themselves', 'their'] claws with the clicking sound of pincers; ['titanic crabs, pointed like a gun on its carri['titanic crabs, pointed like a gun on its carriage', 'its']', 'its']; and ['frightful-looking poulps, interweaving their tenta['frightful-looking poulps, interweaving their tentacles like a living nest of serpents', 'their']like a living nest of serpents', 'their']. 
 
['We', 'us'] had now arrived on the first platform, where other surprises awaited ['me', 'I', 'me']. Before ['We', 'us'] lay some picturesque ruins, which betrayed the hand of man and not that of the Creator. There were vast heaps of stone, amongst which might be traced the vague and shadowy forms of castles and temples, clothed with a world of blossoming zoophytes, and over which, instead of ivy, sea-weed and fucus threw a thick vegetable mantle. But what was this portion of the globe which had been swallowed by cataclysms? Who had placed those rocks and stones like cromlechs of prehistoric times? Where was ['me', 'I', 'me']? Whither had Captain Nemo’s fancy hurried ['me', 'I', 'me']? 
 
['I', 'I', 'I'] would fain have asked ['him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'he']; not being able to, ['I', 'I', 'I'] stopped ['him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'he']—['I', 'I', 'I'] seized ['him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'he'] arm. But, shaking ['him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'he'] head, and pointing to the highest point of the mountain, ['him', 'him', 'his', 'his', 'he'] seemed to say: 
 
“Come, come along; come higher!” 
 
['I', 'I'] followed, and in a few minutes ['I', 'I'] had climbed to the top, which for a circle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock. 
 
['I', 'My'] looked down the side we had just climbed. ['The mountain', 'it', 'the mountain'] did not rise more than seven or eight hundred feet above the level of the plain; but on the opposite side ['The mountain', 'it', 'the mountain'] commanded from twice that height the depths of this part of the Atlantic. ['I', 'My'] eyes ranged far over a large space lit by a violent fulguration. In fact, ['The mountain', 'it', 'the mountain'] was a volcano. 
 
At fifty feet above the peak, in the midst of a rain of stones and scoriae, ['a large crater', 'this volcano', 'the submarine crater'] was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell in a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass. Thus situated, ['a large crater', 'this volcano', 'the submarine crater'] lit the lower plain like an immense torch, even to the extreme limits of the horizon. I said that ['a large crater', 'this volcano', 'the submarine crater'] threw up lava, but no flames. Flames require the oxygen of the air to feed upon and cannot be developed under water; but ['streams of lava', 'themselves', 'their'], having in ['streams of lava', 'themselves', 'their'] the principles of ['streams of lava', 'themselves', 'their'] incandescence, can attain a white heat, fight vigorously against ['the liquid element', 'it'], and turn ['the liquid element', 'it'] to vapour by contact. 
 
Rapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion and torrents of lava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of Vesuvius on another Terra del Greco. 
 
There indeed under ['my', 'my['my eyes', 'my eyes'], ruined, destroyed, lay a town—['its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] roofs open to the sky, ['its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] temples fallen, ['its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] arches dislocated, ['its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] columns lying on the ground, from which one would still recognise the massive character of Tuscan architecture. Further on, some remains of a gigantic aqueduct; here the high base of an Acropolis, with the floating outline of a Parthenon; there traces of a quay, as if ['an ancient port', 'its', 'its'] had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean, and disappeared with ['an ancient port', 'its', 'its'] merchant vessels and ['an ancient port', 'its', 'its'] war-galleys. Farther on again, long lines of sunken walls and broad, deserted streets—a perfect Pompeii escaped beneath the waters. Such was the sight that Captain Nemo brought before ['my', 'my['my eyes', 'my eyes']! 
 
Where was ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me']? Where was ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me']? ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] must know at any cost. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] tried to speak, but Captain Nemo stopped ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] by a gesture, and, picking up a piece of chalk-stone, advanced to a rock of black basalt, and traced the one word: 
 
ATLANTIS 
 
What a light shot through ['my', 'I', 'my'] mind! ['Atlantis!', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its'] the Atlantis of Plato, that continent denied by Origen and Humbolt, who placed ['Atlantis!', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its'] disappearance amongst the legendary tales. ['my', 'I', 'my'] had ['Atlantis!', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its'] there now before ['my', 'I', 'my'] eyes, bearing upon ['Atlantis!', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its'] the unexceptionable testimony of ['Atlantis!', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its'] catastrophe. The region thus engulfed was beyond Europe, Asia, and Lybia, beyond the columns of Hercules, where those powerful people, the Atlantides, lived, against whom the first wars of ancient Greeks were waged. 
 
Thus, led by the strangest destiny, ['I', 'my', 'I'] was treading under foot the mountains of this continent, touching with ['I', 'my', 'I'] hand those ruins a thousand generations old and contemporary with the geological epochs. ['I', 'my', 'I'] was walking on the very spot where the contemporaries of the first man had walked. 
 
Whilst ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] was trying to fix in ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] mind every detail of this grand landscape, ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'himself', 'his', 'The Captain', 'him'] remained motionless, as if petrified in mute ecstasy, leaning on a mossy stone. Was ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'himself', 'his', 'The Captain', 'him'] dreaming of ['those generations long since disappeared', 'them']? Was ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'himself', 'his', 'The Captain', 'him'] asking ['those generations long since disappeared', 'them'] the secret of human destiny? Was it here ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'himself', 'his', 'The Captain', 'him'] came to steep ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'himself', 'his', 'The Captain', 'him'] in historical recollections, and live again this ancient life—he who wanted no modern one? What would ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] not have given to know ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'himself', 'his', 'The Captain', 'hi['his thoughts', 'them', 'them'], to share ['his thoughts', 'them', 'them'], to understand ['his thoughts', 'them', 'them']! We remained for an hour at this place, contemplating the vast plains under the brightness of the lava, which was some times wonderfully intense. Rapid tremblings ran along the mountain caused by internal bubblings, deep noise, distinctly transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with majestic grandeur. At this moment ['the moon', 'her', 'It'] appeared through the mass of waters and threw ['the moon', 'her', 'It'] pale rays on the buried continent. ['the moon', 'her', 'It'] was but a gleam, but what an indescribable effect! ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'himself', 'his', 'The Captain', 'him'] rose, cast one last look on the immense plain, and then bade ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] follow ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'this strange man', 'himself', 'his', 'The Captain', 'him']. 
 
['We', 'we'] descended the mountain rapidly, and, the mineral forest once passed, I saw ['the lantern of the _Nautilus_', 'it'] shining like a star. The Captain walked straight to ['the lantern of the _Nautilus_', 'it'], and ['We', 'we'] got on board as the first rays of light whitened the surface of the ocean. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER X THE SUBMARINE COAL-MINES 
 
The next day, the 20th of February, ['I', 'my', 'I'] awoke very late: the fatigues of the previous night had prolonged ['I', 'my', 'I'] sleep until eleven o’clock. ['I', 'my', 'I'] dressed quickly, and hastened to find the course ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] was taking. The instruments showed ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] to be still toward the south, with a speed of twenty miles an hour and a depth of fifty fathoms. 
 
The species of fishes here did not differ much from those already noticed. There were rays of giant size, five yards long, and endowed with great muscular strength, which enabled them to shoot above the waves; sharks of many kinds; amongst others, ['one fifteen feet long, with triangular sharp teeth, and whose transparency rendered it almos['one fifteen feet long, with triangular sharp teeth, and whose transparency rendered it almost invisible in the water', 'it']invisible in the water', 'it']. 
 
Amongst bony fish Conseil noticed some about three yards long, armed at the upper jaw with a piercing sword; ['other bright-coloured creatures, known in the time of Aristotle by the name of the sea-dragon', 'their'], which are dangerous to capture on account of the spikes on ['other bright-coloured creatures, known in the time of Aristotle by the name of the sea-dragon', 'their'] back. 
 
About four o’clock, ['the soil, generally composed of a thick mud mixed with petrified wood', 'it'], changed by degrees, and ['the soil, generally composed of a thick mud mixed with petrified wood', 'it'] became more stony, and seemed strewn with conglomerate and pieces of basalt, with a sprinkling of lava. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] thought that a mountainous region was succeeding the long plains; and accordingly, after a few evolutions of the _Nautilus_, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] saw the southerly horizon blocked by ['a high wall which seemed to close all exit', 'Its', 'It']. ['a high wall which seemed to close all exit', 'Its', 'It'] summit evidently passed the level of the ocean. ['a high wall which seemed to close all exit', 'Its', 'It'] must be a continent, or at least an island—one of the Canaries, or of the Cape Verde Islands. The bearings not being yet taken, perhaps designedly, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] was ignorant of ['our', 'we'] exact position. In any case, such a wall seemed to ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] to mark the limits of that Atlantis, of which ['our', 'we'] had in reality passed over only the smallest part. 
 
Much longer should ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] have remained at the window admiring the beauties of sea and sky, but the panels closed. At this moment ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] arrived at the side of this high, perpendicular wall. What ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] would do, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could not guess. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] returned to ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] room; ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] no longer moved. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] laid ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] down with the full intention of waking after a few hours’ sleep; but it was eight o’clock the next day when ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] entered the saloon. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] looked at ['the manometer', 'It']. ['the manometer', 'It'] told ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] that ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] was floating on the surface of the ocean. Besides, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] heard steps on the platform. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] went to ['the panel', 'It']. ['the panel', 'It'] was open; but, instead of broad daylight, as ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] expected, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was surrounded by ['profound darkness', 'that utter darkness']. Where were we? Was ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] mistaken? Was it still night? No; not a star was shining and night has not ['profound darkness', 'that utter darkness']. 
 
[Illustration] The _Nautilus_ was floating near a mountain 
 
['I', 'me'] knew not what to think, when a voice near ['I', 'me'] said: 
 
“Is that ['you', 'Professor'], ['you', 'Professor']?” 
 
“Ah! Captain,” I answered, “where are we?” 
 
“Underground, sir.” 
 
“Underground!” I exclaimed. “And the _Nautilus_ floating still?” 
 
“It always floats.” 
 
“But I do not understand.” 
 
“Wait a few minutes, our lantern will be lit, and, if you like light places, you will be satisfied.” 
 
['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] stood on the platform and waited. The darkness was so complete that ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] could not even see Captain Nemo; but, looking to the zenith, exactly above ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] head, ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] seemed to catch ['an undecided gleam, a kind of twilight filling a circular hole', 'the slight gleam of light, evidently daylight']. At this instant ['the lantern', 'its'] was lit, and ['the lantern', 'its'] vividness dispelled the faint light. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] closed ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] dazzled eyes for an instant, and then looked again. ['The _Nautilus_', 'The lake', 'it', 'Its', 'the lake'] was stationary, floating near a mountain which formed a sort of quay. ['The _Nautilus_', 'The lake', 'it', 'Its', 'the lake'], then, supporting ['The _Nautilus_', 'The lake', 'it', 'Its', 'the lake'] was a lake imprisoned by a circle of walls, measuring two miles in diameter and six in circumference. ['The _Nautilus_', 'The lake', 'it', 'Its', 'the lake'] level (the manometer showed) could only be the same as the outside level, for there must necessarily be a communication between ['The _Nautilus_', 'The lake', 'it', 'Its', 'the lake'] and the sea. ['The high partitions', 'their'], leaning forward on ['The high partitions', 'their'] base, grew into a vaulted roof bearing the shape of an immense funnel turned upside down, the height being about five or six hundred yards. At the summit was a circular orifice, by which ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] had caught ['an undecided gleam, a kind of twilight filling a circular hole', 'the slight gleam of light, evidently daylight']. 
 
“Where are we?” I asked. 
 
“In the very heart of an extinct volcano, the interior of which has been invaded by the sea, after some great convulsion of the earth. Whilst ['you', 'Professor', 'me', 'you', 'your'] were sleeping, ['you', 'Professor', 'me', 'you', 'your'], ['the _Nautilus_', 'its'] penetrated to this lagoon by ['a natural canal, which opens about ten yards beneath the surface of the ocean', 'This']. ['a natural canal, which opens about ten yards beneath the surface of the ocean', 'This'] is ['the _Nautilus_', 'its'] harbour of refuge, a sure, commodious, and mysterious one, sheltered from all gales. Show ['you', 'Professor', 'me', 'you', 'your'], if ['you', 'Professor', 'me', 'you', 'your'] can, on the coasts of any of ['you', 'Professor', 'me', 'you', 'your'] continents or islands, a road which can give such perfect refuge from all storms.” 
 
“Certainly,” ['I', 'I'] replied, “['you', 'Captain Nemo', 'you'] are in safety here, ['you', 'Captain Nemo', 'you']. Who could reach ['you', 'Captain Nemo', 'you'] in the heart of ['a volcano', 'its']? But did ['I', 'I'] not see an opening at ['a volcano', 'its'] summit?” 
 
“Yes; its crater, formerly filled with lava, vapour, and flames, and which now gives entrance to the life-giving air we breathe.” 
 
“But what is this volcanic mountain?” 
 
“['It', 'it'] belongs to one of the numerous islands with which this sea is strewn—to vessels a simple sandbank—to us an immense cavern. ['Chance', 'chance'] led ['me', 'me'] to discover ['It', 'it'], and ['Chance', 'chance'] served ['me', 'me'] well.” 
 
“But of what use is this refuge, Captain? The _Nautilus_ wants no port.” 
 
“No, sir; but ['it', 'it'] wants ['electricity', 'the electricity'] to make ['it', 'it'] move, and the wherewithal to make ['electricity', 'the electricity']—['sodium to feed the elements', 'the sodium'], coal from which to get ['sodium to feed the elements', 'the sodium'], and a coal-mine to supply the coal. And exactly on this spot the sea covers ['entire forests embedded during the geological periods, now mineralised and transformed into coal', 'they']; for me ['entire forests embedded during the geological periods, now mineralised and transformed into coal', 'they'] are an inexhaustible mine.” 
 
“['Your', 'Captain'] men follow the trade of miners here, then, ['Your', 'Captain']?” 
 
“Exactly so. These mines extend under the waves like the mines of Newcastle. Here, in ['their', 'my men'] diving-dresses, pick axe and shovel in hand, ['their', 'my['my', 'I', 'I']en'] extract ['the coal, which I do not even ask from['my', 'I', 'I']the mines of the earth', 'this combustible']. When ['my', 'I', 'I'] burn ['the coal, which I do not even ask from the mines of the earth', 'this combustible'] for the manufacture of sodium, the smoke, escaping from the crater of ['the mountain', 'it'], gives ['the mountain', 'it'] the appearance of a still-active volcano.” 
 
“And we shall see your companions at work?” 
 
“No; not this time at least; for ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] am in a hurry to continue ['our', 'we', 'ou['our submarine tour of the earth', 'our voyage']. So ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] shall content ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] with drawing from the reserve of sodium ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] already possess. The time for loading is one day only, and ['our', 'we', 'our'] continue ['our', 'we', 'ou['our submarine tour of the earth', 'our voyage']. So, if ['you', 'you'] wish to go over the cavern and make the round of the lagoon, ['you', 'you'] must take advantage of to-day, M. Aronnax.” 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] thanked the Captain and went to look for ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me['my companions, who had not yet left their cabin', 'thei['my companions, who had not yet left their cabin', 'their', 'them']them']. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] invited ['my companions, who had not yet left their cabin', 'their', 'them'] to follow ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] without saying where ['we', 'They', 'we'] were. ['we', 'They', 'we'] mounted the platform. ['Conseil, who was astonished at nothing', 'he'], seemed to look upon it as quite natural that ['Conseil, who was astonished at nothing', 'he'] should wake under ['a mountain', 'the mountain'], after having fallen asleep under the waves. But Ned Land thought of nothing but finding whether the cavern had any exit. After breakfast, about ten o’clock, ['we', 'They', 'we'] went down on to ['a mountain', 'the mountain']. 
 
“Here we are, once more on land,” said Conseil. 
 
“['I', 'the Canadian'] do not call ['this', 'this land', 'it', '['this', 'this land', 'it', 'it'],” said ['I', 'the Canadian']. “And besides, we are not on ['this', 'this land', 'it', 'it'], but beneath ['this', 'this land', 'it', 'it'].” 
 
Between the walls of the mountains and the waters of ['the lake', 'the lake'] lay ['a sandy shore which, at its greatest breadth, measured five['a sandy shore which, at its greatest breadth, measured five hundred feet', 'its', 'this soil', 'the shore']ndred feet', 'its', 'this soil', 'the shore']. On ['a sandy shore which, at its greatest breadth, measured five hundred feet', 'its', 'this soil', 'the shore'] one might easily make the tour of ['the lake', 'the lake']. But the base of the high partitions was stony ground, with volcanic locks and enormous pumice-stones lying in picturesque heaps. All these detached masses, covered with enamel, polished by the action of the subterraneous fires, shone resplendent by the light of ['our', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'we'] electric lantern. The mica dust from ['a sandy shore which, at its greatest breadth, measured five hundred feet', 'its', 'this soil', 'the shore'], rising under ['our', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'we'] feet, flew like a cloud of sparks. The bottom now rose sensibly, and ['our', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'we'] soon arrived at long circuitous slopes, or inclined planes, which took ['our', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'we'] higher by degrees; but ['our', 'our', 'we', 'us', 'we'] were obliged to walk carefully among these conglomerates, bound by no cement, the feet slipping on the glassy crystal, felspar, and quartz. 
 
The volcanic nature of this enormous excavation was ['confirmed', 'it'] on all sides, and ['I', 'my'] pointed ['confirmed', 'it'] out to ['I', 'my'] companions. 
 
“Picture to yourselves,” said I, “what this crater must have been when filled with boiling lava, and when the level of the incandescent liquid rose to the orifice of the mountain, as though melted on the top of a hot plate.” 
 
“['I', 'Conseil', 'me'] can picture it perfectly,” said ['I', 'Conseil', 'me']. “But, ['sir', 'you'], will ['sir', 'you'] tell ['I', 'Conseil', 'me'] why the Great Architect has suspended operations, and how it is that the furnace is replaced by the quiet waters of the lake?” 
 
“Most probably, Conseil, because some convulsion beneath the ocean produced that very opening which has served as a passage for ['the _Nautilus_', 'the mountain', 'the submerged volcano']. Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed into the interior of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the mountain', 'the submerged volcano']. There must have been a terrible struggle between the two elements, a struggle which ended in the victory of Neptune. But many ages have run out since then, and ['the _Nautilus_', 'the mountain', 'the submerged volcano'] is now a peaceable grotto.” 
 
“Very well,” replied ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I']; “['Ned Land', 'I', 'I'] accept the explanation, ['sir', 'you']; but, in our own interests, ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I'] regret that the opening of which ['sir', 'you'] speak was not made above the level of the sea.” 
 
“But, friend Ned,” said Conseil, “if ['the passage', 'it'] had not been under the sea, the _Nautilus_ could not have gone through ['the passage', 'it'].” 
 
['We', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'our'] continued ascending. The steps became more and more perpendicular and narrow. ['Deep excavations, which we were ob['We', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'our']ged to cross', 'them'], cut ['Deep excavations, which we were obliged to cross', 'them'] here and there; sloping masses had to be turned. ['We', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'our'] slid upon ['We', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'our'] knees and crawled along. But Conseil’s dexterity and the Canadian’s strength surmounted all obstacles. At a height of about 31 feet the nature of the ground changed without becoming more practicable. To the conglomerate and trachyte succeeded black basalt, the first dispread in layers full of bubbles, the latter forming regular prisms, placed like a colonnade supporting the spring of the immense vault, an admirable specimen of natural architecture. Between the blocks of basalt wound ['long streams of lava, long since grown cold, encrusted with bituminous rays', 'the streams of lava']; and in some places there were spread large carpets of sulphur. A more powerful light shone through the upper crater, shedding a vague glimmer over these volcanic depressions for ever buried in the bosom of this extinguished mountain. But ['We', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'our'] upward march was soon stopped at a height of about two hundred and fifty feet by impassable obstacles. There was a complete vaulted arch overhanging ['We', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'our'], and ['We', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'our'] ascent was changed to a circular walk. At the last change vegetable life began to struggle with the mineral. Some shrubs, and even some trees, grew from the fractures of the walls. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] recognised ['some euphorbias', 'them'], with the caustic sugar coming from ['some euphorbias', 'them']; ['heliotropes', 'their', 'their'], quite incapable of justifying ['heliotropes', 'their', 'their'] name, sadly drooped ['heliotropes', 'their', 'th['their clusters of flowers, both their colou['their clusters of flowers, both their colour and perfume half gone', 'their'] perfume half gone', 'their']. Here and there some chrysanthemums grew timidly at the foot of an aloe with long, sickly-looking leaves. But between ['long streams of lava, long since grown cold, encrusted with bituminous rays', 'the streams of lava'], ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw ['some little violets still slightly perfumed', 'them'], and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] admit that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] smelt ['some little violets still slightly perfumed', 'them'] with delight. Perfume is the soul of the flower, and sea-flowers have no soul. 
 
We had arrived at the foot of ['some sturdy dragon-trees, which had pushed aside the rocks with their stron['some sturdy dragon-trees, which had pushed aside the rocks with their strong roots', 'their']ts', 'their'], when Ned Land exclaimed: 
 
“Ah! sir, a hive! a hive!” 
 
“A hive!” I replied, with a gesture of incredulity. 
 
“Yes, ['a hive', 'it'],” repeated the Canadian, “and bees humming round ['a hive', 'it'].” 
 
['I', 'my', 'I'] approached, and was bound to believe ['I', 'my', 'I'] own eyes. There at a hole bored in one of the dragon-trees were some thousands of these ingenious insects, so common in all the Canaries, and whose produce is so much esteemed. Naturally enough, ['the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] wished to gather the honey, and ['I', 'my', 'I'] could not well oppose ['the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] wish. A quantity of dry leaves, mixed with sulphur, ['the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] lit with a spark from ['the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] flint, and ['the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he'] began to smoke out the bees. The humming ceased by degrees, and the hive eventually yielded several pounds of the sweetest honey, with which ['Ned Land', 'his'] filled ['Ned Land', 'his'] haversack. 
 
“When ['I', 'he', 'I'] have mixed this honey with the paste of the bread-fruit,” said ['I', 'he', 'I'], “['I', 'he', 'I'] shall be able to offer you a succulent cake.” 
 
[Transcriber’s Note: ’bread-fruit’ has been substituted for ’artocarpus’ in this ed.] 
 
“’Pon ['my', 'Conseil'] word,” said ['my', 'Conseil'], “it will be gingerbread.” 
 
“Never mind the gingerbread,” said I; “let ['us', 'our'] continue ['us', 'our'] interesting walk.” 
 
At every turn of the path ['we', 'We', 'We', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] were following, ['the lake', 'its', 'its'] appeared in all ['the lake', 'its', 'its'] length and breadth. The lantern lit up the whole of ['the lake', 'its', 'its'] peaceable surface, which knew neither ripple nor wave. ['The _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] remained perfectly immovable. On the platform, and on ['the mountain', 'this volcano', 'the mountain', 'the volcano'], ['The _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus['the ship’s crew', 'The crew'] were working like black shadows clearly carved against the luminous atmosphere. ['we', 'We', 'We', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] were now going round ['the highest crest of the first layers of rock which upheld the roof', 'it', 'the crest']. ['I', 'I'] then saw that bees were not the only representatives of the animal kingdom in the interior of ['the mountain', 'this volcano', 'the mountain', 'the volcano']. ['Birds of prey', 'their'] hovered here and there in the shadows, or fled from ['Birds of prey', 'their'] nests on the top of the rocks. There were ['sparrow hawks, with white breasts, and kestrels', 'their'], and down the slopes scampered, with ['sparrow hawks, with white breasts, and kestrels', 'their'] long legs, several fine fat bustards. ['I', 'I'] leave anyone to imagine the covetousness of ['the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Canadian’s'] at the sight of this savoury game, and whether ['the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Canadian’s'] did not regret having no gun. But ['the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Canadian’s'] did ['the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Canadian’s'] best to replace the lead by stones, and, after several fruitless attempts, ['the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Canadian’s'] succeeded in wounding ['a magnificent bird', 'the creature']. To say that ['the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Canadian’s'] risked ['the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Canadian’s'] life twenty times before reaching ['the highest crest of the first layers of rock which upheld the roof', 'it', 'the crest'] is but the truth; but ['the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Canadian’s'] managed so well that ['a magnificent bird', 'the creature'] joined the honey-cakes in ['the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Canadian’s'] bag. ['we', 'We', 'We', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] were now obliged to descend toward ['the shore', 'the inner shore'], ['the highest crest of the first layers of rock which upheld the roof', 'it', 'the crest'] becoming impracticable. Above ['we', 'We', 'We', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] ['the crater', 'this place'] seemed to gape like the mouth of a well. From ['the crater', 'this place'] the sky could be clearly seen, and ['clouds', 'them', 'their', 'they'], dissipated by the west wind, leaving behind ['clouds', 'them', 'their', 'they'], even on the summit of ['the mountain', 'this volcano', 'the mountain', 'the volcano'], ['clouds', 'them', 'their', 'they'] misty remnants—certain proof that ['clouds', 'them', 'their', 'they'] were only moderately high, for ['the mountain', 'this volcano', 'the mountain', 'the volcano'] did not rise more than eight hundred feet above the level of ['the ocean', 'the Atlantic']. Half an hour after ['the Canadian', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'the Canadian’s'] last exploit ['we', 'We', 'We', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] had regained ['the shore', 'the inner shore']. Here the flora was represented by large carpets of marine crystal, a little umbelliferous plant very good to pickle, which also bears the name of pierce-stone and sea-fennel. Conseil gathered some bundles of it. As to ['the fauna', 'it'], ['the fauna', 'it'] might be counted by thousands of crustacea of all sorts, lobsters, crabs, spider-crabs, chameleon shrimps, and a large number of shells, rockfish, and limpets. Three-quarters of an hour later ['we', 'We', 'We', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] had finished ['we', 'We', 'We', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] circuitous walk and were on board. ['the ship’s crew', 'The crew'] had just finished loading the sodium, and ['The _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] could have left that instant. But ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] gave no order. Did ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] wish to wait until night, and leave the submarine passage secretly? Perhaps so. Whatever it might be, the next day, ['The _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'], having left ['The _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] port, steered clear of all land at a few yards beneath the waves of ['the ocean', 'the Atlantic']. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XI THE SARGASSO SEA 
 
That day ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] crossed a singular part of ['the Atlantic Ocean', 'the open Atlantic', 'the Atlantic', 'the Atlantic']. No one can be ignorant of the existence of ['a current of warm water known by the name of the Gulf Stream', 'this current', 'the great current']. After leaving the Gulf of Florida, we went in the direction of Spitzbergen. But before entering the Gulf of Mexico, about 45° of N. lat., ['a current of warm water known by the name of the Gulf Stream', 'this current', 'the great current'] divides into two arms, the principal one going towards the coast of Ireland and Norway, whilst the second bends to the south about the height of the Azores; then, touching the African shore, and describing a lengthened oval, returns to the Antilles. ['This second arm', 'it', 'its']—['This second arm', 'it', 'its'] is rather a collar than an arm—surrounds with ['This second arm', 'it', 'its'] circles of warm water ['that portion of the cold, quiet, immovable ocean called the Sargasso Sea, a perfect lake in the open['the Atlantic Ocean', 'the open Atlantic', 'the Atlantic', 'the Atlantic']: it takes no less than three years for ['a current of warm water known by the name of the Gulf Stream', 'this current', 'the great current'] to pass round ['that portion of the cold, quiet, immovable ocean called the Sargasso Sea, a perfect lake in the open Atlantic', 'it']. Such was the region ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] was now visiting, a perfect meadow, a close carpet of seaweed, fucus, and tropical berries, so thick and so compact that ['the stem of a vessel', 'its'] could hardly tear ['the stem of a vessel', 'its'] way through ['it', 'this herbaceous mass']. And ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he'], not wishing to entangle ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he'] screw in ['it', 'this herbaceous mass'], kept some yards beneath the surface of the waves. The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word “sargazzo” which signifies kelp. This kelp, or berry-plant, ['is', 'this'] the principal formation of this immense bank. And ['is', 'this'] is the reason why these plants unite in the peaceful basin of ['the Atlantic Ocean', 'the open Atlantic', 'the Atlantic', 'the Atlantic']. The only explanation which can be given, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he'] says, seems to me to result from the experience known to all the world. Place in ['a vase', 'the vase', 'the vase'] ['some fragments of cork or other floating body', 'the scattered fragments', 'the floating bodies'], and give to the water in ['a vase', 'the vase', 'the vase'] a circular movement, ['some fragments of cork or other floating body', 'the scattered fragments', 'the floating bodies'] will unite in a group in the centre of the liquid surface, that is to say, in the part least agitated. In the phenomenon we are considering, ['the Atlantic Ocean', 'the open Atlantic', 'the Atlantic', 'the Atlantic'] is ['a vase', 'the vase', 'the vase'], the Gulf Stream the circular current, and the Sargasso Sea the central point at which ['some fragments of cork or other floating body', 'the scattered fragments', 'the floating bodies'] unite. 
 
['I', 'I'] share ['Maury’s', 'Maury’s'] opinion, and ['I', 'I'] was able to study the phenomenon in the very midst, where vessels rarely penetrate. Above us floated products of all kinds, heaped up among these brownish plants; trunks of trees torn from the Andes or the Rocky Mountains, and floated by the Amazon or the Mississippi; numerous wrecks, remains of keels, or ships’ bottoms, side-planks stove in, and so weighted with shells and barnacles that they could not again rise to the surface. And time will one day justify ['Maury’s', 'Maury’s'] other opinion, that these substances thus accumulated for ages will become petrified by the action of the water and will then form inexhaustible coal-mines—a precious reserve prepared by far-seeing Nature for the moment when men shall have exhausted the mines of continents. 
 
In the midst of this inextricable mass of plants and sea weed, I noticed ['some charming pink halcyons and actiniae, with their long tentacle['some charming pink halcyons and actiniae, with their long tentacles trailing after them, and medusæ, green, red, and blue', 'their', 'them']iling after them, and medusæ, g['some charming pink halcyons and actiniae, with their long tentacles trailing after them, and medusæ, green, red, and blue', 'their', 'them'], red, and blue', 'their', 'them']. 
 
All the day of the 22nd of February ['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'our'] passed in the Sargasso Sea, where such fish as are partial to marine plants find abundant nourishment. The next, ['the ocean', 'its'] had returned to ['the ocean', 'its'] accustomed aspect. From this time for nineteen days, from the 23rd of February to the 12th of March, ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat', 'the _Nautilus'] kept in the middle of the Atlantic, carrying ['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'our'] at a constant speed of a hundred leagues in twenty-four hours. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him'] evidently intended accomplishing ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him'] submarine programme, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] imagined that ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him'] intended, after doubling Cape Horn, to return to ['the Australian seas of the Pacific', 'these large seas, void of islands']. Ned Land had cause for fear. In ['the Australian seas of the Pacific', 'these large seas, void of islands'], ['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'our'] could not attempt to leave ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat', 'the _Nautilus']. Nor had ['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'our'] any means of opposing ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him'] will. ['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'our'] only course was to submit; but what ['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'our'] could neither gain by force nor cunning, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] liked to think might be obtained by persuasion. This voyage ended, would ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him'] not consent to restore ['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'ou['our liberty', 'this liberty'], under an oath never to reveal ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him'] existence?—an oath of honour which ['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'our'] should have religiously kept. But ['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'our'] must consider that delicate question with ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him']. But was ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] free to claim ['our liberty', 'this liberty']? Had ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him'] not ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him'] said from the beginning, in the firmest manner, that the secret of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him'] life exacted from ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him'] ['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'our'] lasting imprisonment on board ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat', 'the _Nautilus']?_ And would not ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] four months’ silence appear to ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'he', 'himself', 'his', 'him', 'him'] a tacit acceptance of ['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'ou['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'ou['we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'Our', 'we', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our', 'ou['our projects', 'them'], if at some future time a favourable opportunity offered to return to ['our projects', 'them']? 
 
During the nineteen days mentioned above, no incident of any kind happened to signalise ['our', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'u['our voyage', 'our voyage']. ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] saw little of ['the Captain', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'the Captain', 'himself', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo']; ['the Captain', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'the Captain', 'himself', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] was at work. In the library ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] often found ['the Captain', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'the Captain', 'himself', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] books left open, especially those on natural history. ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me['My work on submarine depths', 'my work', 'it'], conned over by ['the Captain', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'the Captain', 'himself', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'], was covered with marginal notes, often contradicting ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] theories and systems; but ['the Captain', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'the Captain', 'himself', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] contented ['the Captain', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'the Captain', 'himself', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] with thus purging ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me['My work on submarine depths', 'my work', 'it']; it was very rare for ['the Captain', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'the Captain', 'himself', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] to discuss ['My work on submarine depths', 'my work', 'it'] with ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me']. Sometimes ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] heard the melancholy tones of ['the Captain', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'the Captain', 'himself', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] organ; but only at night, in the midst of the deepest obscurity, when ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] slept upon ['the deserted ocean', 'The sea', 'the ocean']. During this part of ['our', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'u['our voyage', 'our voyage'] ['our', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us'] sailed whole days on the surface of the waves. ['the deserted ocean', 'The sea', 'the ocean'] seemed abandoned. A few sailing-vessels, on the road to India, were making for the Cape of Good Hope. One day ['our', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us'] were followed by the boats of a whaler, who, no doubt, took ['our', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us'] for some enormous whale of great price; but ['the Captain', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'the Captain', 'himself', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] did not wish ['the worthy fellows', 'their'] to lose ['the worthy fellows', 'their'] time and trouble, so ended the chase by plunging under the water. ['our', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us'] navigation continued until ['the 13th of March', 'that day']; ['the 13th of March', 'that day'] ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] was employed in taking soundings, which greatly interested ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me']. ['our', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us'] had then made about 13,000 leagues since ['our', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us'] departure from the high seas of the Pacific. The bearings gave ['our', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'Our', 'We', 'our', 'us'] 45° 37′ S. lat., and 37° 53′ W. long. It was the same water in which Captain Denham of the Herald sounded 7,000 fathoms without finding the bottom. There, too, Lieutenant Parker, of the American frigate Congress, could not touch the bottom with 15,140 fathoms. ['the Captain', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'the Captain', 'himself', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] intended seeking the bottom of ['the deserted ocean', 'The sea', 'the ocean'] by a diagonal sufficiently lengthened by means of lateral planes placed at an angle of 45° with the water-line of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_']. Then ['the screw', 'its', 'its'] set to work at ['the screw', 'its', 'its'] maximum speed, ['the screw', 'its', 'its'] four blades beating the waves with in describable force. Under this powerful pressure, the hull of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] quivered like a sonorous chord and sank regularly under the water. 
 
At 7,000 fathoms ['I', 'I'] saw ['some blackish tops', 'these summits'] rising from the midst of ['the waters', 'the waters']; but ['some blackish tops', 'these summits'] might belong to high mountains like the Himalayas or Mont Blanc, even higher; and the depth of the abyss remained incalculable. ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'this firm structure', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] descended still lower, in spite of the great pressure. ['I', 'I'] felt the steel plates tremble at the fastenings of the bolts; ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'this firm structure', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] bars bent, ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'this firm structure', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] partitions groaned; the windows of the saloon seemed to curve under the pressure of ['the waters', 'the waters']. And ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'this firm structure', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] would doubtless have yielded, if, as ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'this firm structure', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] Captain had said, ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'this firm structure', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] had not been capable of resistance like a solid block. We had attained a depth of 16,000 yards (four leagues), and the sides of ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'this firm structure', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] then bore a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres, that is to say, 3,200 lbs. to each square two-fifths of an inch of ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'this firm structure', 'its', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] surface. 
 
“What a situation to be in!” I exclaimed. “To overrun these deep regions where man has never trod! Look, Captain, look at ['these magnificent rocks, these uninhabited grottoes, these lowest receptacles of the globe, where life is no longer possible', 'them']! What unknown sights are here! Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of ['these magnificent rocks, these uninhabited grottoes, these lowest receptacles of the globe, where life is no longer possible', 'them']?” 
 
“Would you like to carry away more than the remembrance?” said Captain Nemo. 
 
“What do you mean by those words?” 
 
“I mean to say that nothing is easier than to make a photographic view of this submarine region.” 
 
['I', 'my'] had not time to express ['I', 'my'] surprise at this new proposition, when, at Captain Nemo’s call, an objective was brought into the saloon. Through the widely-opened panel, the liquid mass was bright with electricity, which was distributed with such uniformity that not a shadow, not a gradation, was to be seen in our manufactured light. ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'the instrument'] remained motionless, the force of ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'the instrument'] screw subdued by the inclination of ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'the instrument'] planes: ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'the instrument'] was propped on the bottom of the oceanic site, and in a few seconds we had obtained a perfect negative. 
 
But, the operation being over, Captain Nemo said, “Let ['us', 'we', 'our'] go up; ['us', 'we', 'our'] must not abuse ['us', 'we', 'our'] position, nor expose the _Nautilus_ too long to such great pressure.” 
 
“Go up again!” I exclaimed. 
 
“Hold well on.” 
 
['I', 'me', 'I'] had not time to understand why ['the Captain', 'the Captain'] cautioned ['I', 'me', 'I'] thus, when ['I', 'me', 'I'] was thrown forward on to the carpet. At a signal from ['the Captain', 'the Captain'], ['its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] screw was shipped, and ['its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] blades raised vertically; ['its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] shot into the air like a balloon, rising with stunning rapidity, and cutting the mass of waters with a sonorous agitation. Nothing was visible; and in four minutes ['its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] had shot through the four leagues which separated ['its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] from the ocean, and, after emerging like a flying-fish, fell, making the waves rebound to an enormous height. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XII CACHALOTS AND WHALES 
 
During the nights of the 13th and 14th of March, ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] returned to ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] southerly course. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] fancied that, when on a level with Cape Horn, ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] would turn the helm westward, in order to beat the Pacific seas, and so complete the tour of the world. ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] did nothing of the kind, but continued on ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] way to the southern regions. Where was ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] going to? To the pole? It was madness! ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] began to think that ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] temerity justified Ned Land’s fears. For some time past ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] had not spoken to ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] of ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] projects of flight; ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] was less communicative, almost silent. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] could see that this lengthened imprisonment was weighing upon ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'], and ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] felt that rage was burning within ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him']. When ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] met ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'], ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] eyes lit up with suppressed anger; and ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] feared that ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] natural violence would lead ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'the Captain’s', 'the Canadian', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'the Captain', 'his', 'his', 'him'] into some extreme. That day, the 14th of March, ['Conseil'['Conseil and he', 'their['Conseil', 'he'] came to ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] in ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] room. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I'] inquired the cause of ['Conseil and he', 'their'] visit. 
 
“A simple question to ask ['you', 'sir', 'the Canadian'], ['you', 'sir', 'the Canadian'],” replied ['you', 'sir', 'the Canadian']. 
 
“Speak, Ned.” 
 
“How many men are there on board the _Nautilus_, do you think?” 
 
“['I', 'my'] cannot tell, ['I', 'my'] friend.” 
 
“I should say that its working does not require a large crew.” 
 
“Certainly, under existing conditions, ten men, at the most, ought to be enough.” 
 
“Well, why should there be any more?” 
 
“Why?” ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] replied, looking fixedly at Ned Land, whose meaning was easy to guess. “Because,” ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] added, “if ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] surmises are correct, and if ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] have well understood ['the Captain’s', 'its commander'] existence, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its'] is not only a vessel: ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its'] is also a place of refuge for those who, like ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it['the Captain’s', 'its commander'], have broken every tie upon earth.” 
 
“Perhaps so,” said ['Conseil', 'you', 'sir']; “but, in any case, the _Nautilus_ can only contain ['a certain number of men', 'their']. Could not ['Conseil', 'you', 'sir'], ['Conseil', 'you', 'sir'], estimate ['a certain number of men', 'their'] maximum?” 
 
“How, Conseil?” 
 
“By calculation; given the size of ['the vessel', 'it'], which ['you', 'sir'] know, ['you', 'sir'], and consequently the quantity of air ['the vessel', 'it'] contains, knowing also how much each man expends at a breath, and comparing these results with the fact that the _Nautilus_ is obliged to go to the surface every twenty-four hours.” 
 
['Conseil', 'he'] had not finished the sentence before I saw what ['Conseil', 'he'] was driving at. 
 
“['I', 'I'] understand,” said ['I', 'I']; “but that calculation, though simple enough, can give but a very uncertain result.” 
 
“Never mind,” said Ned Land urgently. 
 
“Here it is, then,” said I. “In one hour each man consumes the oxygen contained in twenty gallons of air; and in twenty-four, that contained in 480 gallons. We must, therefore find how many times 480 gallons of air the _Nautilus_ contains.” 
 
“Just so,” said Conseil. 
 
“Or,” I continued, “the size of ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] being 1,500 tons; and one ton holding 200 gallons, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] contains 300,000 gallons of air, which, divided by 480, gives a quotient of 625. Which means to say, strictly speaking, that the air contained in ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] would suffice for 625 men for twenty-four hours.” 
 
“Six hundred and twenty-five!” repeated Ned. 
 
“But remember that all of us, passengers, sailors, and officers included, would not form a tenth part of that number.” 
 
“Still too many for three men,” murmured Conseil. 
 
['The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his'] shook ['The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his'] head, passed ['The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his'] hand across ['The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his'] forehead, and left the room without answering. 
 
“Will ['you', 'me', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'you', 'sir'] allow ['you', 'me', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'you', 'sir'] to make one observation, ['you', 'me', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'you', 'sir']?” said ['you', 'me', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'you', 'sir']. “['Poor Ned', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his'] is longing for everything that ['Poor Ned', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his'] can not have. ['Poor Ned', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his'] past life is always present to ['Poor Ned', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his']; everything that ['we', 'we', 'we'] are forbidden ['Poor Ned', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his'] regrets. ['Poor Ned', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his'] head is full of old recollections. And ['we', 'we', 'we'] must understand ['Poor Ned', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his']. What has ['Poor Ned', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his'] to do here? Nothing; ['Poor Ned', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his'] is not learned like ['you', 'me', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'you', 'sir'], ['you', 'me', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'you', 'sir']; and has not the same taste for the beauties of the sea that ['we', 'we', 'we'] have. ['Poor Ned', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his'] would risk everything to be able to go once more into a tavern in ['Poor Ned', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'His', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his'] own country.” 
 
Certainly the monotony on board must seem intolerable to ['the Canadian, accustomed as he was to a lif['the Canadian, accustomed as he was to a life of liberty and activity', 'he', 'him']of liberty and activity', 'he', 'him']. Events were rare which could rouse ['the Canadian, accustomed as he was to a life of liberty and activity', 'he', 'him'] to any show of spirit; but that day an event did happen which recalled the bright days of the harpooner. About eleven in the morning, being on the surface of the ocean, the _Nautilus_ fell in with ['a troop of whales', 'these creatures, hunted to death']—an encounter which did not astonish me, knowing that ['a troop of whales', 'these creatures, hunted to death'], had taken refuge in high latitudes. 
 
['We', 'us'] were seated on the platform, with a quiet sea. The month of October in those latitudes gave ['We', 'us'] some lovely autumnal days. It was the Canadian—he could not be mistaken—who signalled ['a whale on the eastern horizon', 'its']. Looking attentively, one might see ['a whale on the eastern horizon', 'its'] black back rise and fall with the waves five miles from the _Nautilus_. 
 
“Ah!” exclaimed ['Ned Land', 'I', 'me', 'I'], “if ['Ned Land', 'I', 'me', 'I'] was on board ['a whaler', 'It', 'its'], now such a meeting would give ['Ned Land', 'I', 'me', 'I'] pleasure. ['a whaler', 'It', 'its'] is one of large size. See with what strength ['a whaler', 'It', 'its'] blow-holes throw up columns of air an steam! Confound it, why am ['Ned Land', 'I', 'me', 'I'] bound to these steel plates?” 
 
“What, ['Ned', 'you', 'your'],” said I, “['Ned', 'you', 'your'] have not forgotten ['Ned', 'you', 'your'] old ideas of fishing?” 
 
“Can ['a whale-fisher', 'his', 'he'] ever forget ['a whale-fisher', 'his', 'he'] old trade, sir? Can ['a whale-fisher', 'his', 'he'] ever tire of the emotions caused by such a chase?” 
 
“['You', 'Ned'] have never fished in these seas, ['You', 'Ned']?” 
 
“Never, sir; in the northern only, and as much in Behring as in Davis Straits.” 
 
“Then ['the southern whale', 'It'] is still unknown to you. ['the southern whale', 'It'] is ['the Greenland whale you have hunted up to this time', 'that'], and ['the Greenland whale you have hunted up to this time', 'that'] would not risk passing through the warm waters of the equator. ['Whales', 'their', 'they', 'these creatures'] are localised, according to ['Whales', 'their', 'they', 'these creatures'] kinds, in certain seas which ['Whales', 'their', 'they', 'these creatures'] never leave. And if one of ['Whales', 'their', 'they', 'these creatures'] ['went', 'it'] from Behring to Davis Straits, ['went', 'it'] must be simply because there is a passage from one sea to the other, either on the American or the Asiatic side.” 
 
“In that case, as ['I', 'I'] have never fished in ['these seas', 'them'], ['I', 'I'] do not know the kind of whale frequenting ['these seas', 'them']!” 
 
“I have told ['you', 'Ned'], ['you', 'Ned'].” 
 
“A greater reason for making their acquaintance,” said Conseil. 
 
“Look! look!” exclaimed ['the Canadian', 'me', 'I'], “['they', 'they', 'they', 'them'] approach: ['they', 'they', 'they', 'them'] aggravate ['the Canadian', 'me', 'I']; ['they', 'they', 'they', 'them'] know that ['the Canadian', 'me', 'I'] cannot get at ['they', 'they', 'they', 'them']!” 
 
['Ned', 'his', 'His', 'he'] stamped ['Ned', 'his', 'His', 'he'] feet. ['Ned', 'his', 'His', 'he'] hand trembled, as ['Ned', 'his', 'His', 'he'] grasped an imaginary harpoon. 
 
“Are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas?” asked he. 
 
“Very nearly, Ned.” 
 
“Because ['I', 'I'] have seen large whales, sir, whales measuring a hundred feet. ['I', 'I'] have even been told that those of Hullamoch and Umgallick, of the Aleutian Islands, are sometimes a hundred and fifty feet long.” 
 
“That seems to me exaggeration. These creatures are only balaeaopterons, provided with dorsal fins; and, like the cachalots, are generally much smaller than the Greenland whale.” 
 
“Ah!” exclaimed the Canadian, whose eyes had never left the ocean, “['they', 'they'] are coming nearer; ['they', 'they'] are in the same water as the _Nautilus_.” 
 
Then, returning to the conversation, he said: 
 
“You spoke of the cachalot as a small creature. I have heard of ['gigantic ones', 'They', 'they', 'themselves', 'them']. ['gigantic ones', 'They', 'they', 'themselves', 'them'] are intelligent cetacea. It is said of some that ['gigantic ones', 'They', 'they', 'themselves', 'them'] cover ['gigantic ones', 'They', 'they', 'themselves', 'them'] with seaweed and fucus, and then are taken for islands. People encamp upon ['gigantic ones', 'They', 'they', 'themselves', 'them'], and settle there; lights a fire——” 
 
“And build houses,” said Conseil. 
 
“Yes, joker,” said Ned Land. “And one fine day ['the creature', 'it'] plunges, carrying with ['the creature', 'it'] all the inhabitants to the bottom of the sea.” 
 
“Something like the travels of Sinbad the Sailor,” I replied, laughing. 
 
“Ah!” suddenly exclaimed ['Ned Land', 'I'], “['it', 'it'] is not one whale; there are ten—there are twenty—['it', 'it'] is a whole troop! And ['Ned Land', 'I'] not able to do anything! hands and feet tied!” 
 
“But, ['friend Ned', 'you'],” said Conseil, “why do ['friend Ned', 'you'] not ask Captain Nemo’s permission to chase them?” 
 
['Conseil', 'his'] had not finished ['Conseil', 'his'] sentence when ['Ned Land', 'himself'] had lowered ['Ned Land', 'himself'] through the panel to seek the Captain. A few minutes afterwards the two appeared together on the platform. 
 
Captain Nemo watched the troop of cetacea playing on the waters about a mile from the _Nautilus_. 
 
“They are southern whales,” said he; “there goes the fortune of a whole fleet of whalers.” 
 
“Well, ['sir', 'the Canadian', 'I', 'me', 'my'],” asked ['sir', 'the Canadian', 'I', 'me', 'my'], “can ['sir', 'the Canadian', 'I', 'me', 'my'] not chase them, if only to remind ['sir', 'the Canadian', 'I', 'me', 'my'] of ['sir', 'the Canadian', 'I', 'me', 'my'] old trade of harpooner?” 
 
“And to what purpose?” replied Captain Nemo; “only to destroy! We have nothing to do with the whale-oil on board.” 
 
“But, ['sir', 'you'],” continued the Canadian, “in the Red Sea ['sir', 'you'] allowed us to follow the dugong.” 
 
“Then it was to procure fresh meat for ['my', 'I', 'I'] crew. Here it would be ['killing', 'that'] for killing’s sake. ['my', 'I', 'I'] know ['killing', 'that'] is a privilege reserved for man, but ['my', 'I', 'I'] do not approve of such murderous pastime. In destroying the southern whale (like the Greenland whale, an inoffensive creature), ['your', 'Master Land', 'y['your traders', 'They'] do a culpable action, ['your', 'Master Land', 'you']. ['your traders', 'They'] have already depopulated the whole of Baffin’s Bay, and are annihilating a class of useful animals. Leave ['the unfortunate cetacea', 'They', 'them'] alone. ['the unfortunate cetacea', 'They', 'them'] have plenty of natural enemies—cachalots, swordfish, and sawfish—without ['your', 'Master Land', 'you'] troubling ['the unfortunate cetacea', 'They', 'them'].” 
 
['The Captain', 'Captain Nemo'] was right. The barbarous and inconsiderate greed of these fishermen will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the ocean. ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] whistled “Yankee-doodle” between ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] teeth, thrust ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] hands into ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] pockets, and turned ['Ned Land', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'his'] back upon us. But ['The Captain', 'Captain Nemo'] watched the troop of cetacea, and, addressing me, said: 
 
“I was right in saying that whales had ['natural enemies', 'These'] enough, without counting man. ['natural enemies', 'These'] will have plenty to do before long. Do ['you', 'M. Aronnax'] see, ['you', 'M. Aronnax'], about eight miles to leeward, those blackish moving points?” 
 
“Yes, Captain,” I replied. 
 
“['Those', 'those', 'they', 'them'] are cachalots—terrible animals, which I have met in troops of two or three hundred. As to ['Those', 'those', 'they', 'them'], ['Those', 'those', 'they', 'them'] are cruel, mischievous creatures; they would be right in exterminating ['Those', 'those', 'they', 'them'].” 
 
The Canadian turned quickly at the last words. 
 
“Well, ['Captain', 'he'],” said ['Captain', 'he'], “it is still time, in the interest of the whales.” 
 
“It is useless to expose one’s self, Professor. ['The _Nautilus_', 'It'] will disperse them. ['The _Nautilus_', 'It'] is armed with a steel spur as good as Master Land’s harpoon, I imagine.” 
 
['The Canadian', 'himself', 'his'] did not put ['The Canadian', 'himself', 'his'] out enough to shrug ['The Canadian', 'himself', 'his'] shoulders. Attack cetacea with blows of a spur! Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
 
“Wait, ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'],” said Captain Nemo. “['We', 'We'] will show ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'] something ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'] have never yet seen. ['We', 'We'] have no pity for ['these ferocious creatures', 'They']. ['these ferocious creatures', 'They'] are nothing but mouth and teeth.” 
 
Mouth and teeth! No one could better describe ['the macrocephalous cachalot, which is sometimes more than seventy-five feet long', 'Its', 'its', 'it']. ['the macrocephalous cachalot, which is sometimes more than seventy-five feet long', 'Its', 'its', 'i['Its enormous head', 'this enormous head'] occupies one-third of ['the macrocephalous cachalot, which is sometimes more than seventy-five feet long', 'Its', 'its', 'it'] entire body. Better armed than the whale, whose upper jaw is furnished only with whalebone, ['the macrocephalous cachalot, which is sometimes more than seventy-five feet long', 'Its', 'its', 'it'] is supplied with twenty-five large tusks, about eight inches long, cylindrical and conical at the top, each weighing two pounds. It is in the upper part of ['Its enormous head', 'this enormous head'], in great cavities divided by cartilages, that is to be found from six to eight hundred pounds of that precious oil called spermaceti. ['The cachalot', 'It', 'its', 'its'] is a disagreeable creature, more tadpole than fish, according to Fredol’s description. ['The cachalot', 'It', 'its', 'its'] is badly formed, the whole of ['The cachalot', 'It', 'its', 'its'] left side being (if we may say it), a “failure,” and being only able to see with ['The cachalot', 'It', 'its', 'its'] right eye. But ['the formidable troop', 'They'] was nearing ['us', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us']. ['the formidable troop', 'They'] had seen ['the whales', 'them', 'the whales', 'the whales', 'the fleshy mass', 'the animal'] and were preparing to attack ['the whales', 'them', 'the whales', 'the whales', 'the fleshy mass', 'the animal']. One could judge beforehand that ['the cachalots', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'the cachalots'] would be victorious, not only because ['the cachalots', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'the cachalots'] were better built for attack than ['the cachalots', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'the cachalots'] inoffensive adversaries, but also because ['the cachalots', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'the cachalots'] could remain longer under water without coming to the surface. There was only just time to go to the help of ['the whales', 'them', 'the whales', 'the whales', 'the fleshy mass', 'the animal']. ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this new monster', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'itself', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] went under water. ['Conseil, Ned Land, and I', 'our', 'our', ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'himself', 'he']'they'['I', 'I', 'I'] took ['Conseil, Ned Land, and I', 'our', 'our', 'They', 'they'] places before the window in the saloon, and ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'its Captain', 'Captain Nemo'] joined ['the pilot', 'his'] in ['the pilot', 'his'] cage to work ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'its Captain', 'Captain Nemo'] apparatus as an engine of destruction. Soon ['I', 'I', 'I'] felt the beatings of the screw quicken, and ['Conseil, Ned Land, and I', 'our', 'our', 'They', 'they'] speed increased. ['The battle between the cachalots and ['the cachalots', 'they', 'their', 'they', 'th['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fle['the whales', 'them', 'the whales', 'the whales', 'the fleshy mass', 'the animal'] had already begun when ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this new monster', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'itself', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] arrived. ['Conseil, Ned Land, and I', 'our', 'our', 'They', 'they'] did not at first show any fear at the sight of ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this new monster', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'itself', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] joining in ['The battle between the cachalots and the whales', 'the conflict']. But ['Conseil, Ned Land, and I', 'our', 'our', 'They', 'they'] soon had to guard against ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this new monster', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'itself', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] blows. What a battle! ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this new monster', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'itself', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] was nothing but a formidable harpoon, brandished by the hand of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'its Captain', 'Cap['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this new monster', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'itself', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_']n Nemo'].

What carnage! What a noise on the surface of ['the waves', 'the waves', 'The waves']! What sharp hissing, and what snorting peculiar to ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass']! In the midst of these waters, generally so peaceful, ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass'] tails made perfect billows. For one hour this wholesale massacre continued, from which ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass'] could not escape. Several times ten or twelve united tried to crush ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this new monster', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'itself', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] by ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass'] weight. From the window ['us', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us'] could see ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass'] enormous mouths, studded with tusks, and ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass'] formidable eyes. ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'himself', 'he'] could not contain ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'himself', 'he']; ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'himself', 'he'] threatened and swore at ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass']. ['us', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us'] could feel ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass'] clinging to ['us', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'u['our vessel', 'the vessel'] like dogs worrying a wild boar in a copse. But ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this new monster', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'itself', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'], working ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this new monster', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'itself', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] screw, carried ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass'] here and there, or to the upper levels of the ocean, without caring for ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass'] enormous weight, nor the powerful strain on ['our vessel', 'the vessel']. At length ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass'] broke up, ['the waves', 'the waves', 'The waves'] became quiet, and ['I', 'I', 'I'] felt that ['us', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us'] were rising to ['the surface', 'the surface']. The panel opened, and ['us', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us'] hurried on to the platform. The sea was covered with mutilated bodies. A formidable explosion could not have divided and torn ['the cachalots and the whales', 'their', 'these enraged animals', 'their', 'the cachalots', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'their', 'the mass of cachalots', 'this fleshy mass'] with more violence. ['us', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us'] were floating amid gigantic bodies, bluish on the back and white underneath, covered with enormous protuberances. Some terrified cachalots were flying towards the horizon. ['the waves', 'the waves', 'The waves'] were dyed red for several miles, and ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'this new monster', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'itself', 'it', 'It', 'its', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] floated in a sea of blood: ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'its Captain', 'Captain Nemo'] joined ['us', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us']. 
 
“Well, Master Land?” said he. 
 
“Well, sir,” replied ['the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had somewhat calmed', 'I', 'I', 'I']; “['it', 'this'] is a terrible spectacle, certainly. But ['the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had somewhat calmed', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am not a butcher. ['the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had somewhat calmed', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am a hunter, and ['the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had somewhat calmed', 'I', 'I', 'I'] call ['it', 'this'] a butchery.” 
 
“It is a massacre of mischievous creatures,” replied the Captain; “and the _Nautilus_ is not a butcher’s knife.” 
 
“['I', 'my', 'the Canadian'] like ['I', 'my', 'the Canadian'] harpoon better,” said ['I', 'my', 'the Canadian']. 
 
“Every one to his own,” answered the Captain, looking fixedly at Ned Land. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] feared ['he', 'his'] would commit some act of violence, which would end in sad consequences. But ['he', 'his'] anger was turned by the sight of ['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it']. ['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it'] had not quite escaped from ['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it'] teeth. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] recognised ['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it'] by ['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it'] flat head, which is entirely black. Anatomically, ['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it'] is distinguished from the white whale and the North Cape whale by the seven cervical vertebrae, and ['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it'] has two more ribs than ['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it'] congeners. ['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it'] was lying on ['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it'] side, riddled with holes from the bites, and quite dead. From ['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it'] mutilated fin still hung ['a young whale which it could not save from the massacre', '['a whale which the _Nautilus_ had just come up with', 'The creature', 'the cachalot’s', 'the southern whale', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its', 'The unfortunate cetacean', 'its', 'its', 'it']s', 'the creature', 'its', 'its']. ['a young whale which it could not save from the massacre', 'Its', 'the creature', 'its', 'its'] open mouth let the water flow in and out, murmuring like the waves breaking on the shore. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'The Captain', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] steered close to the corpse of ['a young whale which it could not save from the massacre', 'Its', 'the creature', 'its', 'its']. ['Two of his men', ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'The Captain', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo']ey'] mounted ['a young whale which it could not save from the massacre', 'Its', 'the creature', 'its', 'its'] side, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw, not without surprise, that ['Two of his men', 'they'] were drawing from ['a young whale which it could not save from the massacre', 'Its', 'the creature', 'its', 'it['its breasts', 'they'] ['all the milk which they contained, that is to say, about two or three tons', 'the milk, whic['its breasts', 'they']s still warm', 'the drink', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it']. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'The Captain', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] offered ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] a cup of ['all the milk which they contained, that is to say, about two or three tons', 'the milk, which was still warm', 'the drink', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could not help showing ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] repugnance to ['all the milk which they contained, that is to say, about two or three tons', 'the milk, which was still warm', 'the drink', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it']; but ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'The Captain', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] assured ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] that ['all the milk which they contained, that is to say, about two or three tons', 'the milk, which was still warm', 'the drink', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it'] was excellent, and not to be distinguished from cow’s milk. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] tasted ['all the milk which they contained, that is to say, about two or three tons', 'the milk, which was still warm', 'the drink', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it'], and was of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'The Captain', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] opinion. ['all the milk which they contained, that is to say, about two or three tons', 'the milk, which was still warm', 'the drink', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it'] was a useful reserve to ['us', 'our'], for in the shape of salt butter or cheese ['all the milk which they contained, that is to say, about two or three tons', 'the milk, which was still warm', 'the drink', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it'] would form an agreeable variety from ['us', 'our'] ordinary food. From that day ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] noticed with uneasiness that ['Ned Land’s', 'the Canadian’s'] ill-will towards ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'The Captain', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] increased, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] resolved to watch ['Ned Land’s', 'the Canadian’s'] gestures closely. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XIII THE ICEBERG 
 
['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'The _Nautilus_'] was steadily pursuing ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'The _Nautilus_'] southerly course, following the fiftieth meridian with considerable speed. Did ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'The _Nautilus_'] wish to reach ['the pole', 'that point']? ['I', 'I', 'I'] did not think so, for every attempt to reach ['the pole', 'that point'] had hitherto failed. Again, the season was far advanced, for in the Antarctic regions the 13th of March corresponds with the 13th of September of northern regions, which begin at the equinoctial season. On the 14th of March ['I', 'I', 'I'] saw floating ice in latitude 55°, merely pale bits of debris from twenty to twenty-five feet long, forming banks over which ['the sea', 'the ocean'] curled. ['The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'he', 'The _Nautilus_'] remained on the surface of ['the sea', 'the ocean']. ['Ned Land, who had fished in the Arctic Seas', 'its'], was familiar with ['Ned Land, who had fished in the Arctic Seas', 'it['its icebergs', 'them']; but Conseil and ['I', 'I', 'I'] admired ['its icebergs', 'them'] for the first time. In the atmosphere towards the southern horizon stretched ['a white dazzling band', 'it', 'it']. English whalers have given ['a white dazzling band', 'it', 'it'] the name of “ice blink.” However thick the clouds may be, ['a white dazzling band', 'it', 'it'] is always visible, and announces the presence of an ice pack or bank. Accordingly, ['larger blocks', 'these masses', 'these floating islands'] soon appeared, whose brilliancy changed with the caprices of the fog. Some of ['larger blocks', 'these masses', 'these floating islands'] showed green veins, as if long undulating lines had been traced with sulphate of copper; others resembled ['enormous amethysts with the light shining through them', 'th['enormous amethysts with the light shining through them', 'them']. Some reflected the light of day upon a thousand crystal facets. Others shaded with vivid calcareous reflections resembled a perfect town of marble. The more we neared the south the more ['larger blocks', 'these masses', 'these floating islands'] increased both in number and importance. 
 
At 60° lat. every pass had disappeared. But, seeking carefully, ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'The Captain'] soon found ['a narrow opening, through which he boldl['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'The Captain']slipped, knowing, however, that it would['a narrow opening, through which he boldly slipped, knowing, however, that it would close behind him', 'it']lose behind him', 'i['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'The Captain']. Thus, guided by this clever hand, ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] passed through all the ice with a precision which quite charmed Conseil; icebergs or mountains, ice-fields or smooth plains, seeming to have no limits, ['drift-ice or floating ice-packs', 'they'], plains broken up, called palchs when ['drift-ice or floating ice-packs', 'they'] are circular, and ['streams', 'they'] when ['streams', 'they'] are made up of long strips. The temperature was very low; the thermometer exposed to the air marked 2 deg. or 3° below zero, but ['we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] were warmly clad with fur, at the expense of the sea-bear and seal. The interior of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'], warmed regularly by ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] electric apparatus, defied the most intense cold. Besides, it would only have been necessary to go some yards beneath the waves to find a more bearable temperature. Two months earlier ['we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] should have had perpetual daylight in ['these latitudes', 'these circumpolar regions']; but already ['we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] had had three or four hours of night, and by and by there would be six months of darkness in ['these latitudes', 'these circumpolar regions']. On the 15th of March ['we', 'we', 'we', 'we'] were in the latitude of ['New Shetland and South Orkney', 'them']. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'The Captain'] told me that formerly numerous tribes of seals inhabited ['New Shetland and South Orkney', 'them']; but that ['English and American whalers', 'their'], in ['English and American whalers', 'their'] rage for destruction, massacred ['both old and young', 'they']; thus, where there was once life and animation, ['both old and young', 'they'] had left silence and death. 
 
About eight o’clock on the morning of ['the 16th of March', 'the 16th of March'] ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It'], following the fifty-fifth meridian, cut the Antarctic polar circle. Ice surrounded ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'we'] on ['all sides', 'all sides'], and closed the horizon. But ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself'] went from one opening to another, still going higher. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] cannot express ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] astonishment at the beauties of ['these new regions', 'the grouping']. The ice took most surprising forms. Here ['these new regions', 'the grouping'] formed an oriental town, with innumerable mosques and minarets; there a fallen city thrown to the earth, as it were, by some convulsion of nature. The whole aspect was constantly changed by the oblique rays of the sun, or lost in the greyish fog amidst hurricanes of snow. Detonations and falls were heard on ['all sides', 'all sides'], great overthrows of icebergs, which altered the whole landscape like a diorama. Often seeing no exit, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] thought ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'we'] were definitely prisoners; but, instinct guiding ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself'] at the slightest indication, ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself'] would discover a new pass. ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself'] was never mistaken when ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself'] saw the thin threads of bluish water trickling along ['the ice-fields', 'the ice-fields']; and ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] had no doubt that ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself'] had already ventured into the midst of these Antarctic seas before. On ['the 16th of March', 'the 16th of March'], however, ['the ice-fields', 'the ice-fields'] absolutely ['blocked', 'this obstacle', 'it'] ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'we'] road. It was not ['the iceberg itself', 'itself', 'the brittle mass',['the iceberg itself', 'itself', 'the brittle mass', 'it'], as yet, but vast fields cemented by the cold. But ['blocked', 'this obstacle', 'it'] could not stop ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself']: ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself'] hurled ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'himself'] against ['blocked', 'this obstacle', 'it'] with frightful violence. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It'] entered ['the iceberg itself', 'itself', 'the brittle mass', 'it'] like a wedge, and split ['the iceberg itself', 'itself', 'the brittle mass', 'it'] with frightful crackings. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It'] was the battering ram of the ancients hurled by infinite strength. ['The ice, thrown high in the air', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'its'], fell like hail around ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'we']. By ['The ice, thrown high in the air', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'its'] own power of impulsion ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'w['our apparatus', 'itself'] made a canal for ['our apparatus', 'itself']; some times carried away by ['The ice, thrown high in the air', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'its'] own impetus, ['The ice, thrown high in the air', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'its'] lodged on ['the ice-field', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'], crushing ['the ice-field', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] with ['The ice, thrown high in the air', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'its'] weight, and sometimes buried beneath ['the ice-field', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'], dividing ['the ice-field', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] by a simple pitching movement, producing large rents in ['the ice-field', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it']. Violent gales assailed ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'we'] at this time, accompanied by thick fogs, through which, from one end of the platform to the other, ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'we'] could see nothing. The wind blew sharply from all parts of the compass, and ['the snow', 'it'] lay in such hard heaps that ['us', 'we', 'our', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'we'] had to break ['the snow', 'it'] with blows of a pickaxe. The temperature was always at 5 deg. below zero; every outward part of ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It'] was covered with ice. A rigged vessel would have been entangled in the blocked up gorges. ['A vessel without sails, with electricity for its motiv['A vessel without sails, with electricity for its motive power, and wanting no coal', 'its']ower, and wanting no coal', 'its'], could alone brave such high latitudes. At length, on the 18th of March, after many useless assaults, ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It'] was positively blocked. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'It'] was no longer either streams, packs, or ice-fields, but an interminable and immovable barrier, formed by mountains soldered together. 
 
“An iceberg!” said the Canadian to me. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] knew that to Ned Land, as well as to all other navigators who had preceded ['us', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'], this was an inevitable obstacle. The sun appearing for an instant at noon, ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'The Captain', 'he'] took an observation as near as possible, which gave ['us', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] situation at 51° 30′ long. and 67° 39′ of S. lat. ['us', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] had advanced one degree more in this Antarctic region. Of the liquid surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse. Under the spur of ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] lay stretched a vast plain, entangled with confused blocks. Here and there sharp points and slender needles rising to a height of 200 feet; further on a steep shore, hewn as it were with an axe and clothed with greyish tints; huge mirrors, reflecting a few rays of sunshine, half drowned in the fog. And over this desolate face of nature a stern silence reigned, scarcely broken by the flapping of the wings of petrels and puffins. Everything was frozen—even the noise. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] was then obliged to stop in ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] adventurous course amid these fields of ice. In spite of ['us', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] efforts, in spite of the powerful means employed to break up the ice, ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] remained immovable. Generally, when ['us', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] can proceed no further, ['us', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] have return still open to ['us', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our']; but here return was as impossible as advance, for every pass had closed behind ['us', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our']; and for the few moments when ['us', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] were stationary, ['us', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] were likely to be entirely blocked, which did indeed happen about two o’clock in the afternoon, ['the fresh ice', 'its'] forming around ['the fresh ice', 'its'] sides with astonishing rapidity. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] was obliged to admit that ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'The Captain', 'he'] was more than imprudent. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me'] was on the platform at that moment. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'The Captain', 'he'] had been observing ['us', 'our', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'our'] situation for some time past, when ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'The Captain', 'he'] said to ['I', 'I', 'I', 'me']: 
 
“Well, ['sir', 'you'], what do ['sir', 'you'] think of this?” 
 
“I think that we are caught, Captain.” 
 
[Illustration] The _Nautilus_ was blocked up 
 
“So, ['M. Aronnax', 'you'], ['M. Aronnax', 'you'] really think that ['the _Nautilus_', 'itself'] cannot disengage ['the _Nautilus_', 'itself']?” 
 
“With difficulty, ['Captain', 'you']; for the season is already too far advanced for ['Captain', 'you'] to reckon on the breaking of the ice.” 
 
“Ah! sir,” said ['Captain Nemo', 'I'], in an ironical tone, “['you', 'You'] will always be the same. ['you', 'You'] see nothing but difficulties and obstacles. ['Captain Nemo', 'I'] affirm that not only can ['the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'it'] disengage ['the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'it'], but also that ['the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'it'] can go further still.” 
 
“Further to the South?” I asked, looking at the Captain. 
 
“Yes, sir; it shall go to the pole.” 
 
“To the pole!” I exclaimed, unable to repress a gesture of incredulity. 
 
“Yes,” replied ['the Captain', 'I', 'I'], coldly, “to ['the Antarctic pole', 'that unknown point from whence springs every meridian of the globe']—to ['the Antarctic pole', 'that unknown point from whence springs every meridian of the globe']. You know whether ['the Captain', 'I', 'I'] can do as ['the Captain', 'I', 'I'] please with the _Nautilus!_” 
 
Yes, ['I', 'I', 'my'] knew that. ['I', 'I', 'my'] knew that ['this man', 'Captain Nemo', 'he'] was bold, even to rashness. But to conquer those obstacles which bristled round ['the South Pole', 'it', 'that pole which had never yet been trodden by a human creature'], rendering ['the South Pole', 'it', 'that pole which had never yet been trodden by a human creature'] more inaccessible than the North, which had not yet been reached by the boldest navigators—was it not a mad enterprise, one which only a maniac would have conceived? It then came into ['I', 'I', 'my'] head to ask ['this man', 'Captain Nemo', 'he'] if ['this man', 'Captain Nemo', 'he'] had ever discovered ['the South Pole', 'it', 'that pole which had never yet been trodden by a human creature']? 
 
“No, sir,” ['he', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] replied; “but we will discover it together. Where others have failed, ['he', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] will not fail. ['he', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] have never yet led ['he', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I['my _Nautilus_', 'it'] so far into southern seas; but, ['he', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] repeat, ['my _Nautilus_', 'it'] shall go further yet.” 
 
“['I', 'you', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', 'you'] can well believe ['I', 'you', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', 'you'], ['I', 'you', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', 'you'],” said ['I', 'you', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', 'you'], in a slightly ironical tone. “['I', 'you', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', 'you'] believe ['I', 'you', 'Captain', 'I', 'I', 'you']! Let ['us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us'] go ahead! There are no obstacles for ['us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us']! Let ['us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us'] smash ['this iceberg', 'it', 'it', 'it']! Let ['us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us'] blow ['this iceberg', 'it', 'it', 'it'] up; and, if ['this iceberg', 'it', 'it', 'it'] resists, let ['us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us'] give the _Nautilus_ wings to fly over ['this iceberg', 'it', 'it', 'it']!” 
 
“Over ['it', 'it', 'it'], sir!” said Captain Nemo, quietly; “no, not over ['it', 'it', 'it'], but under ['it', 'it', 'it']!” 
 
“Under it!” ['I', 'my', 'I'] exclaimed, a sudden idea of the Captain’s projects flashing upon ['I', 'my', 'I'] mind. ['I', 'my', 'I'] understood; the wonderful qualities of the _Nautilus_ were going to serve us in this superhuman enterprise. 
 
“['I', 'the Captain', 'I'] see we are beginning to understand one another, ['sir', 'You'],” said ['I', 'the Captain', 'I'], half smiling. “['sir', 'You'] begin to see the possibility—['I', 'the Captain', 'I'] should say the success—of this attempt. That which is impossible for an ordinary vessel is easy to ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it']. If ['a continent', 'the continent'] lies before ['the pole', 'the pole', 'the pole'], ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] must stop before ['a continent', 'the continent']; but if, on the contrary, ['the pole', 'the pole', 'the pole'] is washed by open sea, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] will go even to ['the pole', 'the pole', 'the pole'].” 
 
“Certainly,” said ['I', 'I'], carried away by the Captain’s reasoning; “if the surface of the sea is solidified by the ice, the lower depths are free by the Providential law which has placed the maximum of density of the waters of the ocean one degree higher than freezing-point; and, if ['I', 'I'] am not mistaken, the portion of this iceberg which is above the water is as one to four to that which is below.” 
 
“Very nearly, sir; for ['one foot of iceberg above the sea', 'it'] there are three below ['one foot of iceberg above the sea', 'it']. If ['these ice mountains', 'they'] are not more than 300 feet above the surface, ['these ice mountains', 'they'] are not more than 900 beneath. And what are 900 feet to the _Nautilus?_” 
 
“Nothing, sir.” 
 
“It could even seek at greater depths that uniform temperature of sea-water, and there brave with impunity the thirty or forty degrees of surface cold.” 
 
“Just so, sir—just so,” I replied, getting animated. 
 
“The only difficulty,” continued Captain Nemo, “is that of remaining several days without renewing our provision of air.” 
 
“Is that all? The _Nautilus_ has ['vast reservoirs', 'them', 'they']; ['we', 'us', 'we'] can fill ['vast reservoirs', 'them', 'they'], and ['vast reservoirs', 'them', 'they'] will supply ['we', 'us', 'we'] with all the oxygen ['we', 'us', 'we'] want.” 
 
“Well thought of, ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'],” replied ['the Captain', 'me', 'I', 'my'], smiling. “But, not wishing ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'] to accuse ['the Captain', 'me', 'I', 'my'] of rashness, ['the Captain', 'me', 'I', 'my'] will first give ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'] all ['the Captain', 'me', 'I', 'my'] objections.” 
 
“Have you any more to make?” 
 
“Only one. It is possible, if ['the sea', 'it'] exists at the South Pole, that ['the sea', 'it'] may be covered; and, consequently, we shall be unable to come to the surface.” 
 
“Good, ['sir', 'you']! but do ['sir', 'you'] forget that ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] is armed with a powerful spur, and could we not send ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] diagonally against these fields of ice, which would open at the shocks.” 
 
“Ah! ['sir', 'you'], ['sir', 'you'] are full of ideas to-day.” 
 
“Besides, Captain,” I added, enthusiastically, “why should we not find the sea open at the South Pole as well as at the North? ['The frozen poles of the earth', 'these two points of th['the earth', 'the globe'] do not coincide, either in the southern or in the northern regions; and, until it is proved to the contrary, we may suppose either a continent or an ocean free from ice at ['The frozen poles of the earth', 'these two points of th['the earth', 'the globe'].” 
 
“['I', 'Captain Nemo', 'I', 'my', 'me'] think so too, ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'],” replied ['I', 'Captain Nemo', 'I', 'my', 'me']. “['I', 'Captain Nemo', 'I', 'my', 'me'] only wish ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'] to observe that, after having made so many objections to ['I', 'Captain Nemo', 'I', 'my', 'me['my project', 'its'], ['M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you'] are now crushing ['I', 'Captain Nemo', 'I', 'my', 'me'] with arguments in ['my project', 'its'] favour!” 
 
The preparations for this audacious attempt now began. The powerful pumps of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel, which was soon free', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] were working ['air', 'it'] into ['the reservoirs', 'The usual reservoirs'] and storing ['air', 'it'] at high pressure. About four o’clock, ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] announced the closing of the panels on the platform. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] threw one last look at ['the massive iceberg which we were going to ['we', 'we', 'we']oss', 'the iceberg']. The weather was clear, the atmosphere pure enough, the cold very great, being 12° below zero; but, the wind having gone down, this temperature was not so unbearable. ['About ten men', 'We all', 'all'] mounted the sides of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel, which was soon free', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'], armed with pickaxes to ['break', 'The operation'] the ice around ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel, which was soon free', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its']. ['break', 'The operation'] was quickly performed, for ['the fresh ice', 'the newly-liberated water'] was still very thin. ['About ten men', 'We all', 'al['About ten men', 'We all', 'all'] went below. ['the reservoirs', 'The usual reservoirs'] were filled with ['the fresh ice', 'the newly-liberated water'], and ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel, which was soon free', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] soon descended. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] had taken ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] place with Conseil in the saloon; through the open window we could see the lower beds of the Southern Ocean. The thermometer went up, the needle of the compass deviated on the dial. At about 900 feet, as ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] had foreseen, ['we', 'we', 'we'] were floating beneath the undulating bottom of ['the massive iceberg which we were going to cross', 'the iceberg']. But ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel, which was soon free', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] went lower still—['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel, which was soon free', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] went to the depth of four hundred fathoms. ['The temperature of the water at the surface', 'it'] showed twelve degrees, ['The temperature of the water at the surface', 'it'] was now only ten; ['we', 'we', 'we'] had gained two. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] need not say the temperature of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel, which was soon free', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] was raised by ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel, which was soon free', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its'] heating apparatus to a much higher degree; every manœuvre was accomplished with wonderful precision. 
 
“We shall pass it, if ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil'] please, ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil'],” said ['you', 'sir', 'Conseil']. 
 
“['I', 'I'] believe we shall,” ['I', 'I'] said, in a tone of firm conviction. 
 
In this open sea, ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_'] had taken ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_'] course direct to ['the pole', 'the pole'], without leaving the fifty-second meridian. From 67° 30′ to 90 deg., twenty-two degrees and a half of latitude remained to travel; that is, about five hundred leagues. ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_'] kept up ['a mean speed of twenty-six miles an hour—the speed of an express train', 'that']. If ['a mean speed of twenty-six miles an hour—the speed of an express train', 'that'] was kept up, in forty hours we should reach ['the pole', 'the pole']. 
 
For a part of the night the novelty of the situation kept ['us', 'Our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'We'] at the window. ['The sea', 'it', 'the open polar sea'] was lit with the electric lantern; but ['The sea', 'it', 'the open polar sea'] was deserted; ['fishes', 'they', 'them'] did not sojourn in these imprisoned waters; ['fishes', 'they', 'them'] only found there a passage to take ['fishes', 'they', 'them'] from the Antarctic Ocean to ['The sea', 'it', 'the open polar sea']. ['us', 'Our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'W['Our pace', 'it'] was rapid; ['us', 'Our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'We'] could feel ['Our pace', 'it'] by the quivering of the long steel body. About two in the morning ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] took some hours’ repose, and Conseil did the same. In crossing the waist ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] did not meet ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo']: ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] supposed ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] to be in the pilot’s cage. The next morning, the 19th of March, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] took ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] post once more in ['the saloon', 'the saloon']. The electric log told ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] that the speed of ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] had been slackened. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] was then going towards the surface; but prudently emptying ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] reservoirs very slowly. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] heart beat fast. Were ['us', 'Our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'We'] going to emerge and regain the open polar atmosphere? No! A shock told ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] that ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] had struck the bottom of ['the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'its', 'the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'it'], still very thick, judging from the deadened sound. ['us', 'Our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'We'] had in deed “struck,” to use a sea expression, but in an inverse sense, and at a thousand feet deep. This would give three thousand feet of ice above ['us', 'Our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'We']; one thousand being above the water-mark. ['the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'its', 'the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'it'] was then higher than at ['the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'its', 'the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'it'] borders—not a very reassuring fact. Several times that day ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] tried again, and every time ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] struck the wall which lay like a ceiling above ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_']. Sometimes ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] met with but 900 yards, ['only 200 of which', 'It', 'it'] rose above the surface. ['only 200 of which', 'It', 'it'] was twice the height ['only 200 of which', 'It', 'it'] was when ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] had gone under the waves. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] carefully noted the different depths, and thus obtained a submarine profile of ['the chain', 'it'] as ['the chain', 'it'] was developed under ['the water', 'the waters']. ['That night', 'that night'] no change had taken place in ['us', 'Our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'We'] situation. Still ice between four and five hundred yards in depth! It was evidently diminishing, but, still, what a thickness between ['us', 'Our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'We'] and ['the surface of the ocean', 'the surface of the waters']! It was then eight. According to the daily custom on board ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'], ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] air should have been renewed four hours ago; but ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] did not suffer much, although ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] had not yet made any demand upon ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] reserve of oxygen. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] sleep was painful ['That night', 'that night']; hope and fear besieged ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] by turns: ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] rose several times. The groping of ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] continued. About three in the morning, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] noticed that the lower surface of ['the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'its', 'the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'it'] was only about fifty feet deep. One hundred and fifty feet now separated ['us', 'Our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'We'] from ['the surface of the ocean', 'the surface of th['the water', 'the waters']. ['the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'its', 'the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'it'] was by degrees becoming an ice-field, the mountain a plain. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] eyes never left the manometer. ['us', 'Our', 'we', 'we', 'We', 'us', 'our', 'us', 'us', 'We'] were still rising diagonally to the surface, which sparkled under the electric rays. ['the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'its', 'the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'it'] was stretching both above and beneath into lengthening slopes; mile after mile ['the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'its', 'the iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'The iceberg', 'it'] was getting thinner. At length, at six in the morning of that memorable day, the 19th of March, the door of ['the saloon', 'the saloon'] opened, and ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo'] appeared. 
 
“The sea is open!!” was all he said. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XIV THE SOUTH POLE 
 
I rushed on to the platform. Yes! the open sea, with but a few scattered pieces of ice and moving icebergs—a long stretch of sea; a world of birds in the air, and myriads of fishes under those waters, which varied from intense blue to olive green, according to the bottom. The thermometer marked 3° C. above zero. It was comparatively spring, shut up as ['we', 'our'] were behind this iceberg, whose lengthened mass was dimly seen on ['we', 'our'] northern horizon. 
 
“Are we at the pole?” I asked the Captain, with a beating heart. 
 
“['I', 'he', 'I'] do not know,” ['I', 'he', 'I'] replied. “At noon ['I', 'he', 'I'] will take our bearings.” 
 
“But will ['the sun', 'himself'] show ['the sun', 'himself'] through this fog?” said I, looking at the leaden sky. 
 
“However little it shows, it will be enough,” replied the Captain. 
 
About ten miles south ['a solitary island', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'this land'] rose to a height of one hundred and four yards. ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] made for ['a solitary island', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'this land'], but carefully, for ['the sea', 'the sea'] might be strewn with banks. One hour afterwards ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] had reached ['a solitary island', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'this land'], two hours later ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] had made the round of ['a solitary island', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'this land']. ['a solitary island', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'this land'] measured four or five miles in circumference. A narrow canal separated ['a solitary island', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'this land'] from a considerable stretch of land, perhaps a continent, for ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] could not see ['a solitary island', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'this land'] limits. The existence of ['a solitary island', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'It', 'it', 'its', 'this land'] seemed to give some colour to ['Maury’s', 'The ingenious American', 'he'] theory. ['Maury’s', 'The ingenious American', 'he'] has remarked that, between ['the South Pole', 'the southern pole', 'the South Pole'] and the sixtieth parallel, ['the sea', 'the sea'] is ['covered', 'this fact'] with floating ice of enormous size, which is never met with in the North Atlantic. From ['covered', 'this fact'] ['Maury’s', 'The ingenious American', 'he'] has drawn the conclusion that the Antarctic Circle encloses considerable continents, as icebergs cannot form in open sea, but only on the coasts. According to these calculations, the mass of ice surrounding ['the South Pole', 'the southern pole', 'the South Pole'] forms a vast cap, the circumference of which must be, at least, 2,500 miles. But ['the _Nautilus_', 'The boat', 'it'], for fear of running aground, had stopped about three cable-lengths from a strand over which reared a superb heap of rocks. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The boat', 'it'] was launched; ['the Captain', 'his'], two of ['the Captain', 'his'] men, bearing instruments, ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'him'], and ['myself', 'I', 'the Canadian', 'I'] were in ['the _Nautilus_', 'The boat', 'it']. It was ten in the morning. ['myself', 'I', 'the Canadian', 'I'] had not seen Ned Land. Doubtless ['myself', 'I', 'the Canadian', 'I'] did not wish to admit the presence of ['the South Pole', 'the southern pole', 'the South Pole']. A few strokes of the oar brought ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] to the sand, where ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] ran ashore. ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'him'] was going to jump on to the land, when ['myself', 'I', 'the Canadian', 'I'] held ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'him'] back. 
 
“Sir,” said I to ['Captain Nemo', 'you'], “to ['Captain Nemo', 'you'] belongs the honour of first setting foot on this land.” 
 
“Yes, sir,” said ['the Captain', 'I'], “and if ['the Captain', 'I'] do not hesitate to tread this South Pole, it is because, up to this time, no human being has left a trace there.” 
 
Saying this, ['he', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he'] jumped lightly on to the sand. ['he', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he'] heart beat with emotion. ['he', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he'] climbed a rock, sloping to a little promontory, and there, with ['he', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he'] arms crossed, mute and motionless, and with an eager look, ['he', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he'] seemed to take possession of these southern regions. After five minutes passed in this ecstasy, ['he', 'His', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he'] turned to us. 
 
“When you like, sir.” 
 
['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] landed, followed by Conseil, leaving the two men in the boat. For a long way ['the soil', 'its'] was composed of a reddish sandy stone, something like crushed brick, scoriae, streams of lava, and pumice-stones. One could not mistake ['the soil', 'its'] volcanic origin. In some parts, slight curls of smoke emitted a sulphurous smell, proving that ['the internal fires', 'their'] had lost nothing of ['the internal fires', 'their'] expansive powers, though, having climbed a high acclivity, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] could see no volcano for a radius of several miles. We know that in those Antarctic countries, James Ross found two craters, the Erebus and Terror, in full activity, on the 167th meridian, latitude 77° 32′. The vegetation of this desolate continent seemed to ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] much restricted. Some lichens lay upon the black rocks; some microscopic plants, rudimentary diatomas, a kind of cells placed between two quartz shells; long purple and scarlet weed, supported on little swimming bladders, which the breaking of the waves brought to ['the shore', 'The shore', 'the shore']. These constituted the meagre flora of this region. ['the shore', 'The shore', 'the shore'] was strewn with molluscs, little mussels, and limpets. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] also saw myriads of northern clios, one-and-a-quarter inches long, of which a whale would swallow a whole world at a mouthful; and some perfect sea-butterflies, animating the waters on the skirts of ['the shore', 'The shore', 'the shore']. 
 
There appeared on the high bottoms some coral shrubs, of the kind which, according to James Ross, live in ['the Antarctic seas', 'the Antarctic seas'] to the depth of more than 1,000 yards. Then there were little kingfishers and starfish studding the soil. But where life abounded most was in the air. There ['thousands of birds', 'their'] fluttered and flew of all kinds, deafening ['us', 'us', 'we', 'our'] with ['thousands of birds', 'their'] cries; others crowded the rock, looking at ['us', 'us', 'we', 'our'] as ['us', 'us', 'we', 'our'] passed by without fear, and pressing familiarly close by ['us', 'us', 'we', 'our'] feet. There were ['penguins, so agile in the water, heavy and awkward as they are on the gr['penguins, so agile in the water, heavy and awkward as they are on the ground', 'they', 'they']', 'they', 'they']; ['penguins, so agile in the water, heavy and awkward as they are on the ground', 'they', 'they'] were uttering harsh cries, a large assembly, sober in gesture, but extravagant in clamour. ['Albatrosses', 'their'] passed in the air, the expanse of ['Albatrosses', 'their'] wings being at least four yards and a half, and justly called the vultures of the ocean; some gigantic petrels, and some damiers, a kind of small duck, the underpart of whose body is black and white; then there were a whole series of petrels, some whitish, with brown-bordered wings, others blue, peculiar to ['the Antarctic seas', 'the Antarctic seas'], and so oily, as I told Conseil, that the inhabitants of the Ferroe Islands had nothing to do before lighting them but to put a wick in. 
 
“A little more,” said Conseil, “and ['they', 'them'] would be perfect lamps! After that, we cannot expect Nature to have previously furnished ['they', 'them'] with wicks!” 
 
About half a mile farther on the soil was riddled with ruffs’ nests, a sort of laying-ground, out of which many birds were issuing. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'him', 'He', 'This rash and powerful man', 'he'] had ['some hundreds', 'They', 'their', 'they', 'themselves'] hunted. ['some hundreds', 'They', 'their', 'they', 'themselves'] uttered a cry like the braying of an ass, were about the size of a goose, slate-colour on the body, white beneath, with a yellow line round ['some hundreds', 'They', 'their', 'they', 'themselves'] throats; ['some hundreds', 'They', 'their', 'they', 'themselves'] allowed ['some hundreds', 'They', 'their', 'they', 'themselves'] to be killed with a stone, never trying to escape. But ['the fog', 'the curtain of fog', 'the fog'] did not lift, and at eleven ['the sun', 'itself', 'Its', 'the sun'] had not yet shown ['the sun', 'itself', 'Its', 'the sun']. ['the sun', 'itself', 'Its', 'the su['Its absence', 'it'] made ['me', 'I', 'I'] uneasy. Without ['Its absence', 'it'] no observations were possible. How, then, could ['we', 'we', 'We'] decide whether ['we', 'we', 'We'] had reached the pole? When ['me', 'I', 'I'] rejoined ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'him', 'He', 'This rash and powerful man', 'he'], ['me', 'I', 'I'] found ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'him', 'He', 'This rash and powerful man', 'he'] leaning on a piece of rock, silently watching the sky. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'him', 'He', 'This rash and powerful man', 'he'] seemed impatient and vexed. But what was to be done? ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'him', 'He', 'This rash and powerful man', 'he'] could not command ['the sun', 'itself', 'Its', 'the sun'] as ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'him', 'He', 'This rash and powerful man', 'he'] did the sea. Noon arrived without ['the orb of day', 'itself', 'its'] showing ['the orb of day', 'itself', 'its'] for an instant. ['we', 'we', 'We'] could not even tell ['the orb of day', 'itself', 'its'] position behind ['the fog', 'the curtain of fog', 'the fog']; and soon ['the fog', 'the curtain of fog', 'the fog'] turned to snow. 
 
“Till to-morrow,” said the Captain, quietly, and we returned to the _Nautilus_ amid these atmospheric disturbances. 
 
The tempest of snow continued till the next day. It was impossible to remain on the platform. From the saloon, where ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] was taking notes of incidents happening during this excursion to ['the polar continent', 'this continent'], ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] could hear the cries of petrels and albatrosses sporting in the midst of this violent storm. ['The _Nautilus_', 'it'] did not remain motionless, but skirted the coast, advancing ten miles more to the south in the half-light left by the sun as ['The _Nautilus_', 'it'] skirted the edge of the horizon. ['The next day, the 20th of March', 'that day'], the snow had ceased. The cold was a little greater, the thermometer showing 2° below zero. The fog was rising, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] hoped that ['The next day, the 20th of March', 'that day'] ['our', 'Conseil and myself', 'us', 'our'] observations might be taken. Captain Nemo not having yet appeared, the boat took ['our', 'Conseil and myself', 'us', ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] to land. The soil was still of the same volcanic nature; everywhere were ['traces of lava, scoriae, and basalt', 'them']; but the crater which had vomited ['traces of lava, scoriae, and basalt', 'them'] ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] could not see. Here, as lower down, ['the polar continent', 'this continent'] was alive with ['myriads of birds', 'their']. But ['myriads of birds', 'their'] rule was now divided with ['large troops of sea-mammals, looking at us with the['our', 'Conseil and myself', 'us', 'our'] soft ['large troops of sea-mammals, looking at us with their soft eyes', 'their'], 'their']. There were ['several kinds of seals, some stretched on the earth, some on flakes of ice, many going in and out of the sea', 'They']. ['several kinds of seals, some stretched on the earth, some on flakes of ice, many going in and out of the sea', 'They'] did not flee at ['our', 'Conseil and myself', 'us', 'our'] approach, never having had anything to do with man; and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] reckoned that there were provisions there for hundreds of vessels. 
 
“['Sir', 'you'],” said ['Conseil', 'me'], “will ['Sir', 'you'] tell ['Conseil', 'me'] the names of these creatures?” 
 
“They are seals and morses.” 
 
It was now eight in the morning. Four hours remained to ['us', 'our', 'we'] before the sun could be observed with advantage. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] directed ['us', 'our', 'we'] steps towards a vast bay cut in the steep granite shore. There, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] can aver that ['earth and ice', 'them'] were lost to sight by the numbers of sea-mammals covering ['earth and ice', 'them'], and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] involuntarily sought for old Proteus, the mythological shepherd who watched these immense flocks of Neptune. There were more seals than anything else, forming distinct groups, male and female, ['the father', 'his'] watching over ['the father', 'his'] family, ['the mother', 'her'] suckling ['the mother', 'her'] little ones, some already strong enough to go a few steps. When ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] wished to change ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] place, ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] took little jumps, made by the contraction of ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] bodies, and helped awkwardly enough by ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] imperfect fin, which, as with the lamantin, ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] cousins, forms a perfect forearm. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] should say that, in the water, which is ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] element—the spine of ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] is flexible; with smooth and close skin and webbed feet—['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] swim admirably. In resting on the earth ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] take the most graceful attitudes. Thus the ancients, observing ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] soft and expressive looks, which cannot be surpassed by the most beautiful look a woman can give, ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] clear voluptuous eyes, ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] charming positions, and the poetry of ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] manners, metamorphosed ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'], the male into a triton and the female into a mermaid. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] made Conseil notice the considerable development of the lobes of the brain in ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them']. No mammal, except man, has such a quantity of brain matter; ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] are also capable of receiving a certain amount of education, are easily domesticated, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] think, with other naturalists, that if properly taught ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] would be of great service as fishing-dogs. The greater part of ['they', 'their', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'these creatures', 'they', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'their', 'them', 'these interesting cetaceans', 'they', 'they', 'them'] slept on the rocks or on the sand. Amongst ['these seals, properly so called, which have no external ears (in which they diffe['these seals, properly so called, which have no external ears (in which they differ from the otter, whose ears are prominent)', 'they']om the otter, whose ears are prominent)', 'they'], ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] noticed several varieties of seals about three yards long, with a white coat, bulldog heads, armed with teeth in both jaws, four incisors at the top and four at the bottom, and two large canine teeth in the shape of a fleur-de-lis. Amongst them glided ['sea-elephants, a kind of seal, with short, flexible trunks', 'this species']. ['The giants of this speci['sea-elephants, a kind of seal, with short, flexible trunks', 'this species'] measured twenty feet round and ten yards and a half in length; but ['The giants of this species', 'they'] did not move as ['us', 'our', 'we'] approached. 
 
“These creatures are not dangerous?” asked Conseil. 
 
“No; not unless you attack ['them', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'them']. When ['them', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'them'] have to defend ['them', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'them'] young ['them', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'them'] rage is terrible, and it is not uncommon for ['them', 'they', 'their', 'their', 'them'] to break the fishing-boats to pieces.” 
 
“They are quite right,” said Conseil. 
 
“I do not say they are not.” 
 
Two miles farther on ['we', 'we'] were stopped by ['the promontory which shelters the bay from the southerly winds', 'it']. Beyond ['the promontory which shelters the bay from the southerly winds', 'it'] ['we', 'we'] heard loud bellowings such as a troop of ruminants would produce. 
 
“Good!” said Conseil; “a concert of bulls!” 
 
“No; a concert of morses.” 
 
“They are fighting!” 
 
“They are either fighting or playing.” 
 
We now began to climb the blackish rocks, amid unforeseen stumbles, and over stones which the ice made slippery. More than once ['I', 'my', 'me'] rolled over at the expense of ['I', 'my', 'me'] loins. Conseil, more prudent or more steady, did not stumble, and helped ['I', 'my', 'me'] up, saying: 
 
“If, ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'your'], ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'your'] would have the kindness to take wider steps, ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'your'] would preserve ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'your'] equilibrium better.” 
 
Arrived at the upper ridge of the promontory, I saw a vast white plain covered with ['morses', 'They', 'themselves']. ['morses', 'They', 'themselves'] were playing amongst ['morses', 'They', 'themselves'], and what we heard were bellowings of pleasure, not of anger. 
 
As ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] passed ['these curious animals', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their'] ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] could examine ['these curious animals', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their'] leisurely, for ['these curious animals', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their'] did not move. ['these curious animals', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their'] skins were thick and rugged, of a yellowish tint, approaching to red; ['these curious animals', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their'] hair was short and scant. Some of ['these curious animals', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their'] were four yards and a quarter long. Quieter and less timid than ['these curious animals', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'th['their cousins of the north', 'them'], ['these curious animals', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their'] did not, like ['their cousins of the north', 'them'], place sentinels round the outskirts of ['these curious animals', 'them', 'they', 'Their', 'their', 'them', 'their', 'they', 'their'] encampment. After examining this city of morses, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] began to think of returning. It was eleven o’clock, and, if ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'] found the conditions favourable for observations, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] wished to be present at the operation. ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] followed a narrow pathway running along the summit of the steep shore. At half-past eleven ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] had reached the place where ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] landed. The boat had run aground, bringing ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] saw ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'] standing on a block of basalt, ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'] instruments near ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'], ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'] eyes fixed on ['the northern horizon, near which the sun was then describin['the sun', 'the sun', 'the sun', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its']gthened curve', 'the northern horizon']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] took ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] place beside ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'], and waited without speaking. Noon arrived, and, as before, ['the sun', 'the sun', 'the sun', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its'] did not appear. It was a fatality. Observations were still wanting. If not accomplished to-morrow, ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] must give up all idea of taking any. ['We', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] were indeed exactly at the 20th of March. To-morrow, the 21st, would be the equinox; ['the sun', 'the sun', 'the sun', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its'] would disappear behind the horizon for six months, and with ['the sun', 'the sun', 'the sun', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its'] disappearance the long polar night would begin. Since the September equinox ['the sun', 'the sun', 'the sun', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its'] had emerged from ['the northern horizon, near which the sun was then describing a lengthened curve', 'the northern horizon'], rising by lengthened spirals up to the 21st of December. At this period, the summer solstice of ['the northern regions', 'them'], ['the sun', 'the sun', 'the sun', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its'] had begun to descend; and to-morrow was to shed ['the sun', 'the sun', 'the sun', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'its'] last rays upon ['the northern regions', 'them']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] communicated ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] fears and observations to ['Captain Nemo', 'the Captain', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo']. 
 
“['You', 'M. Aronnax'] are right, ['You', 'M. Aronnax'],” said ['he', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my']; “if to-morrow ['he', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] cannot ['take', 'it'] the altitude of ['the sun', 'the sun'], ['he', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] shall not be able to do ['take', 'it'] for six months. But precisely because chance has led ['he', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] into these seas on the 21st of March, ['he', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my'] bearings will be easy to take, if at twelve we can see ['the sun', 'the sun'].” 
 
“Why, Captain?” 
 
“Because then ['the orb of day', 'its'] described such lengthened curves that it is difficult to measure exactly ['the orb of day', 'its'] height above the horizon, and grave errors may be made with instruments.” 
 
“What will you do then?” 
 
“['I', 'my', 'Captain Nemo', 'I'] shall only use ['I', 'my', 'Captain Nemo', 'I'] chronometer,” replied ['I', 'my', 'Captain Nemo', 'I']. “If to-morrow, the 21st of March, the disc of the sun, allowing for refraction, is exactly cut by the northern horizon, it will show that ['I', 'my', 'Captain Nemo', 'I'] am at the South Pole.” 
 
“Just so,” said I. “But this statement is not mathematically correct, because the equinox does not necessarily begin at noon.” 
 
“Very likely, sir; but the error will not be a hundred yards and we do not want more. Till to-morrow, then!” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] returned on board. Conseil and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] remained to survey the shore, observing and studying until five o’clock. Then ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] went to bed, not, however, without invoking, like the Indian, the favour of the radiant orb. The next day, the 21st of March, at five in the morning, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] mounted the platform. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] found ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] there. 
 
“The weather is lightening a little,” said ['he', 'I']. “['he', 'I'] have some hope. After breakfast we will go on shore and choose a post for observation.” 
 
That point settled, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] sought ['Ned Land', 'him', 'the obstinate Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'this unreflecting fisherman’s']. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] wanted to take ['Ned Land', 'him', 'the obstinate Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'this unreflecting fisherman’s'] with ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I']. But ['Ned Land', 'him', 'the obstinate Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'this unreflecting fisherman’s'] refused, and ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw that ['Ned Land', 'him', 'the obstinate Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'this unreflecting fisherman’s'] taciturnity and ['Ned Land', 'him', 'the obstinate Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'this unreflecting fisherman’s'] bad humour grew day by day. After all, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was not sorry for ['Ned Land', 'him', 'the obstinate Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'this unreflecting fisherman’s'] obstinacy under the circumstances. Indeed, there were too many seals on shore, and ['we', 'we'] ought not to lay such temptation in ['Ned Land', 'him', 'the obstinate Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his', 'this unreflecting fisherman’s'] way. Breakfast over, ['we', 'we'] went on shore. ['The _Nautilus_', 'It'] had gone some miles further up in the night. ['The _Nautilus_', 'It'] was a whole league from the coast, above which reared a sharp peak about five hundred yards high. The boat took with ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] Captain Nemo, two men of the crew, and the instruments, which consisted of a chronometer, a telescope, and a barometer. While crossing, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw numerous whales belonging to the three kinds peculiar to the southern seas; the whale, or the English “right whale,” which has no dorsal fin; the “humpback,” with reeved chest and large, whitish fins, which, in spite of ['its', 'This powerful creature', 'he'] name, do not form wings; and the fin-back, of a yellowish brown, the liveliest of all the cetacea. ['its', 'This powerful creature', 'he'] is heard a long way off when ['its', 'This powerful creature', 'he'] throws to a great height columns of air and vapour, which look like whirlwinds of smoke. ['These different mammals', 'themselves'] were disporting ['These different mammals', 'themselves'] in troops in the quiet waters; and ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could see that this basin of the Antarctic Pole serves as a place of refuge to the cetacea too closely tracked by the hunters. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I'] also noticed large medusæ floating between the reeds. 
 
At nine ['we', 'We', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'we'] landed; ['the sky', 'the sky'] was brightening, the clouds were flying to the south, and the fog seemed to be leaving the cold surface of the waters. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his'] went towards ['the peak, which he doubtless meant to be his observatory', 'this peak, w['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his']ch was half porphyry an['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his']alf basalt']. It was a painful ascent over the sharp lava and the pumice-stones, in an atmosphere often impregnated with a sulphurous smell from the smoking cracks. For a man unaccustomed to walk on land, ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his'] climbed the steep slopes with an agility ['I', 'I', 'My'] never saw equalled and which a hunter would have envied. ['we', 'We', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'we'] were two hours getting to ['the summit of this peak, which['the peak, which he doubtless meant to be his observatory', 'this peak, which was half porphyry and half basalt']. From thence ['we', 'We', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'we'] looked upon ['a vast sea which, towards the north, distinctly traced its bound['a vast sea which, towards the north, distinctly traced its boundary line upon the sky', 'its'] line upon the sky',['the sky', 'the sky']. At ['we', 'We', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'we'] feet lay fields of dazzling whiteness. Over ['we', 'We', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'we'] heads a pale azure, free from fog. To the north ['the disc of the sun', 'the orb', 'the half-disc of th['the sun', 'the sun', 'its', 'the sun'] seemed like a ball of fire, already horned by the cutting of the horizon. From the bosom of the water rose sheaves of liquid jets by hundreds. In the distance lay the _Nautilus_ like a cetacean asleep on the water. Behind ['we', 'We', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'we'], to the south and east, an immense country and a chaotic heap of rocks and ice, the limits of which were not visible. On arriving at ['the summit of this peak, which was half porphyry and half basalt', 'the summit'] ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his'] carefully took ['the mean height of the barometer', 'that'], for ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his'] would have to consider ['the mean height of the barometer', 'that'] in taking ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his'] observations. At a quarter to twelve ['the sun', 'the sun', 'its', 'the sun'], then seen only by refraction, looked like a golden disc shedding ['the sun', 'the sun', 'its', 'the sun'] last rays upon this deserted continent and seas which never man had yet ploughed. Captain Nemo, furnished with a lenticular glass which, by means of a mirror, corrected the refraction, watched ['the disc of the sun', 'the orb', 'the half-disc of the sun'] sinking below the horizon by degrees, following a lengthened diagonal. ['I', 'I', 'My'] held ['the chronometer', 'the chronometer']. ['I', 'I', 'My'] heart beat fast. If the disappearance of ['the disc of the sun', 'the orb', 'the half-disc of th['the sun', 'the sun', 'its', 'the sun'] coincided with twelve o’clock on ['the chronometer', 'the chronometer'], ['we', 'We', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'us', 'we'] were at ['the pole itself', 'it['the pole itself', 'itself']. 
 
“Twelve!” I exclaimed. 
 
“The South Pole!” replied Captain Nemo, in a grave voice, handing me the glass, which showed the orb cut in exactly equal parts by the horizon. 
 
['I', 'my'] looked at the last rays crowning ['the peak', 'its'], and the shadows mounting by degrees up ['the peak', 'its'] slopes. At that moment ['Captain Nemo', 'his'], resting with ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] hand on ['I', 'my'] shoulder, said: 
 
“['I, Captain Nemo', 'I'], on this 21st day of March, 1868, have reached the South Pole on the ninetieth degree; and ['I, Captain Nemo', 'I'] take possession of this part of the globe, equal to one-sixth of the known continents.” 
 
“In whose name, Captain?” 
 
“In my own, sir!” 
 
Saying which, ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] unfurled ['a black banner, bearing an “N” in gold quartered on its bunti['a black banner, bearing an “N” in gold quartered on its bunting', 'its'], 'its']. Then, turning towards the orb of day, whose last rays lapped the horizon of the sea, ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] exclaimed: 
 
“Adieu, ['sun', 'thou radiant orb']! Disappear, ['sun', 'thou radiant orb']! rest beneath ['this open sea', 'its'], and let a night of six months spread ['this open sea', 'its'] shadows over my new domains!” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XV ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT? 
 
The next day, the 22nd of March, at six in the morning, preparations for departure were begun. The last gleams of twilight were melting into night. The cold was great, the constellations shone with wonderful intensity. In the zenith glittered that wondrous Southern Cross—the polar bear of Antarctic regions. The thermometer showed 120 below zero, and when ['the wind', 'it'] freshened ['the wind', 'it'] was most biting. Flakes of ice increased on the open water. The sea seemed everywhere alike. Numerous blackish patches spread on the surface, showing the formation of fresh ice. Evidently the southern basin, frozen during ['the six winter months', 'that time'], was absolutely inaccessible. What became of ['the whales', 'they', 'These creatures', 'they', 'these sea mammals'] in ['the six winter months', 'that time']? Doubtless ['the whales', 'they', 'These creatures', 'they', 'these sea mammals'] went beneath the icebergs, seeking more practicable seas. As to ['the seals and morses, accustomed to live in a hard climate', 'they'], ['the seals and morses, accustomed to live in a hard climate', 'they'] remained on these icy shores. ['the whales', 'they', 'These creatures', 'they', 'these sea mammals'] have the instinct to break ['holes in the ice-field', 'them', 'these holes'] and to keep ['holes in the ice-field', 'them', 'these holes'] open. To ['holes in the ice-field', 'them', 'these holes'] ['the whales', 'they', 'These creatures', 'they', 'these sea mammals'] come for breath; when the birds, driven away by the cold, have emigrated to ['the north', 'the north'], ['the whales', 'they', 'These creatures', 'they', 'these sea mammals'] remain sole masters of the polar continent. But the reservoirs were filling with water, and ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its'] was slowly descending. At 1,000 feet deep ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its'] stopped; ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its'] screw beat the waves, and ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its'] advanced straight towards ['the north', 'the north'] at a speed of fifteen miles an hour. Towards night ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its'] was already floating under the immense body of the iceberg. At three in the morning ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was awakened by a violent shock. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] sat up in ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] bed and listened in the darkness, when ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was thrown into the middle of the room. ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its'], after having struck, had rebounded violently. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] groped along the partition, and by the staircase to ['the saloon, which was lit by the luminous ceiling', 'the saloon']. The furniture was upset. Fortunately the windows were firmly set, and had held fast. The pictures on ['the starboard side', 'its starboard side'], from being no longer vertical, were clinging to the paper, whilst those of the port side were hanging at least a foot from the wall. ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its'] was lying on ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'it['the starboard side', 'its starboard side'] perfectly motionless. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] heard footsteps, and a confusion of voices; but Captain Nemo did not appear. As ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was leaving ['the saloon, which was lit by the luminous ceiling', 'the saloon'], Ned Land and Conseil entered. 
 
“What is the matter?” said I, at once. 
 
“['I', 'you', 'sir', 'Conseil'] came to ask ['I', 'you', 'sir', 'Conseil'], ['I', 'you', 'sir', 'Conseil'],” replied ['I', 'you', 'sir', 'Conseil']. 
 
“Confound it!” exclaimed ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I'], “['the Canadian', 'I', 'I'] know well enough! ['The _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'herself', 'she'] has struck; and, judging by the way ['The _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'herself', 'she'] lies, ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I'] do not think ['The _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'herself', 'she'] will right ['The _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'herself', 'she'] as ['The _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'herself', 'she'] did the first time in Torres Straits.” 
 
“But,” I asked, “has she at least come to the surface of the sea?” 
 
“We do not know,” said Conseil. 
 
“It is easy to decide,” ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] answered. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] consulted ['the manometer', 'it']. To ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] great surprise, ['the manometer', 'it'] showed ['a depth of more than 180 fathoms', 'that']. “What does ['a depth of more than 180 fathoms', 'that'] mean?” ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] exclaimed. 
 
“We must ask Captain Nemo,” said Conseil. 
 
“But where shall we find him?” said Ned Land. 
 
“Follow ['me', 'I', 'my'],” said ['me', 'I', 'my'], to ['me', 'I', 'my'] companions. 
 
['We', 'We all', 'we', 'us'] left ['the saloon', 'the saloon']. There was no one in the library. At the centre staircase, by the berths of ['the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_'] crew, there was no one. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] thought that ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'his'] must be in the pilot’s cage. It was best to wait. ['We', 'We all', 'we', 'us'] returned to ['the saloon', 'the saloon']. For twenty minutes ['We', 'We all', 'we', 'us'] remained thus, trying to hear the slightest noise which might be made on board ['the ship’s', 'the _Nautilus_'], when ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'his'] entered. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'his'] seemed not to see ['We', 'We all', 'we', 'us']; ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'his'] face, generally so impassive, showed signs of uneasiness. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'his'] watched the compass silently, then the manometer; and, going to the planisphere, placed ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'his'] finger on a spot representing the southern seas. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] would not interrupt ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'his']; but, some minutes later, when ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'his'] turned towards ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'], ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] said, using one of ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'his'] own expressions in the Torres Straits: 
 
“An incident, Captain?” 
 
“No, sir; an accident this time.” 
 
“Serious?” 
 
“Perhaps.” 
 
“Is the danger immediate?” 
 
“No.” 
 
“The _Nautilus_ has stranded?” 
 
“Yes.” 
 
“And this has happened—how?” 
 
“From a caprice of nature, not from the ignorance of man. Not a mistake has been made in the working. But we cannot prevent ['equilibrium', 'its'] from producing ['equilibrium', 'its'] effects. We may brave human laws, but we cannot resist natural ones.” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'his'] had chosen a strange moment for uttering this philosophical reflection. On the whole, ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] answer helped me little. 
 
“May I ask, sir, the cause of this accident?” 
 
“['An enormous block of ice, a whole mountain', 'the whole thing'], has turned over,” he replied. “When ['icebergs', 'their', 'their'] are undermined at ['icebergs', 'their', 'their'] base by warmer water or reiterated shocks ['icebergs', 'their', 'their'] centre of gravity rises, and ['An enormous block of ice, a whole mountain', 'the whole thing'] turns over. This is what has happened; ['one of these blocks', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'its'], as ['one of these blocks', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'its'] fell, struck ['one of these blocks', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'its'], then, gliding under ['one of these blocks', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'its'] hull, raised ['one of these blocks', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'its'] with irresistible force, bringing ['one of these blocks', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'its'] into beds which are not so thick, where ['one of these blocks', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'its'] is lying on ['one of these blocks', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'its'] side.” 
 
“But can we not get ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'its'] off by emptying ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'its'] reservoirs, that ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'its'] might regain ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'its'] equilibrium?” 
 
“That, ['sir', 'You'], is being done at this moment. ['sir', 'You'] can hear the pump working. Look at ['the needle of the manometer', 'it']; ['the needle of the manometer', 'it'] shows that ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its'] is rising, but the block of ice is floating with ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its']; and, until some obstacle stops ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its'] ascending motion, our position cannot be altered.” 
 
Indeed, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] still held the same position to starboard; doubtless ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] would right ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] when the block stopped. But at this moment who knows if ['we', 'our', 'we', 'our'] may not be frightfully crushed between the two glassy surfaces? I reflected on all the consequences of ['we', 'our', 'we', 'our'] position. ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] never took ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] eyes off the manometer. Since the fall of the iceberg, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] had risen about a hundred and fifty feet, but ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] still made the same angle with the perpendicular. Suddenly a slight movement was felt in the hold. Evidently ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] was righting a little. ['Things hanging in the saloon', 'their'] were sensibly returning to ['Things hanging in the saloon', 'their'] normal position. The partitions were nearing the upright. No one spoke. With beating hearts ['we', 'our', 'we', 'our'] watched and felt the straightening. The boards became horizontal under ['we', 'our', 'we', 'our'] feet. Ten minutes passed. 
 
“At last we have righted!” I exclaimed. 
 
“Yes,” said Captain Nemo, going to the door of the saloon. 
 
“But are we floating?” I asked. 
 
“Certainly,” he replied; “since the reservoirs are not empty; and, when empty, the _Nautilus_ must rise to the surface of the sea.” 
 
['We', 'us'] were in open sea; but at a distance of about ten yards, on either side of ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'], rose ['a dazzling wall of ice', 'the same wall']. Above and beneath ['a dazzling wall of ice', 'the same wall']. Above, because the lower surface of ['the iceberg', 'the iceberg'] stretched over ['We', 'us'] like ['an immense ceiling', 'The luminous ceiling']. Beneath, because ['the overturned block', 'it'], having slid by degrees, had found a resting-place on the lateral walls, which kept ['the overturned block', 'it'] in that position. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] was really imprisoned in ['a perfect tunnel of ice more than twenty yards in breadth, filled with quiet water', 'it']. It was easy to get out of ['a perfect tunnel of ice more than twenty yards in breadth, filled with quiet water', 'it'] by going either forward or backward, and then make a free passage under ['the iceberg', 'the iceberg'], some hundreds of yards deeper. ['an immense ceiling', 'The luminous ceiling'] had been extinguished, but the saloon was still resplendent with ['intense light', 'It']. ['intense light', 'It'] was the powerful reflection from the glass partition sent violently back to the sheets of ['the lantern', 'the lantern']. I cannot describe the effect of the voltaic rays upon the great blocks so capriciously cut; upon every angle, every ridge, every facet was thrown a different light, according to the nature of the veins running through the ice; ['a dazzling mine of gems, particularly of sapphires', 'their'], ['a dazzling mine of gems, particularly of sapphires', 'their'] blue rays crossing with the green of the emerald. Here and there were opal shades of wonderful softness, running through bright spots like diamonds of fire, the brilliancy of which the eye could not bear. The power of ['the lantern', 'the lantern'] seemed increased a hundredfold, like a lamp through the lenticular plates of a first-class lighthouse. 
 
“How beautiful! how beautiful!” cried Conseil. 
 
“Yes,” I said, “['it', 'it'] is a wonderful sight. Is ['it', 'it'] not, Ned?” 
 
“Yes, confound ['it', 'it', 'it', 'it']! Yes,” answered ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I', 'I'], “['it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] is superb! ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am mad at being obliged to admit ['it', 'it', 'it', 'it']. No one has ever seen anything like ['it', 'it', 'it', 'it']; but the sight may cost ['us', 'we'] dear. And, if ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I', 'I'] must say all, ['Ned Land', 'I', 'I', 'I'] think ['us', 'we'] are seeing here things which God never intended man to see.” 
 
Ned was right, it was too beautiful. Suddenly a cry from Conseil made me turn. 
 
“What is it?” I asked. 
 
“Shut ['your', 'sir', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'his', 'h['your eyes', 'his eyes'], ['your', 'sir', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'his', 'his']! Do not look, ['your', 'sir', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'his', 'his']!” Saying which, ['your', 'sir', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'his', 'his'] clapped ['your', 'sir', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'his', 'his'] hands over ['your', 'sir', 'sir', 'Conseil', 'his', 'hi['your eyes', 'his eyes']. 
 
“But what is the matter, my boy?” 
 
“I am dazzled, blinded.” 
 
['My', 'I', 'I'] eyes turned involuntarily towards the glass, but ['My', 'I', 'I'] could not stand ['the fire which seemed to devour them', 'The fire from these myriads of diamon['them', 'these myriads of diamonds', 'our']. ['My', 'I', 'I'] understood what had happened. The _Nautilus_ had put on full speed. All the quiet lustre of the ice-walls was at once changed into flashes of lightning. ['the fire which seemed to devour them', 'The fire from th['them', 'these myriads of diamonds', 'our'] was blinding. It required some time to calm ['them', 'these myriads of diamonds', 'our'] troubled looks. At last the hands were taken down. 
 
“['Faith', 'it'], ['I', 'Conseil'] should never have believed ['Faith', 'it'],” said ['I', 'Conseil']. 
 
It was then five in the morning; and at that moment a shock was felt at the bows of ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_']. ['I', 'I', 'my'] knew that ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] spur had struck a block of ice. It must have been a false manœuvre, for ['this submarine tunnel, obstructed by blocks', 'the tu['blocks', 'these obstacles'], was not very easy navigation. ['I', 'I', 'my'] thought that ['Captain Nemo', 'his'], by changing ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] course, would either turn ['blocks', 'these obstacles'] or else follow the windings of ['this submarine tunnel, obstructed by blocks', 'the tunnel']. In any case, the road before us could not be entirely blocked. But, contrary to ['I', 'I', 'my'] expectations, ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] took a decided retrograde motion. 
 
“We are going backwards?” said Conseil. 
 
“Yes,” I replied. “This end of the tunnel can have no egress.” 
 
“And then?” 
 
“Then,” said I, “the working is easy. We must go back again, and go out at the southern opening. That is all.” 
 
In speaking thus, ['I', 'I'] wished to appear more confident than ['I', 'I'] really was. But the retrograde motion of ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] was increasing; and, reversing the screw, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] carried us at great speed. 
 
“It will be a hindrance,” said Ned. 
 
“What does it matter, some hours more or less, provided we get out at last?” 
 
“Yes,” repeated Ned Land, “provided we do get out at last!” 
 
For a short time ['I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'me', 'you', 'sir'] walked from the saloon to the library. ['I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'me', 'you', 'sir'] companions were silent. ['I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'me', 'you', 'sir'] soon threw ['I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'me', 'you', 'sir'] on an ottoman, and took a book, which ['I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'me', 'you', 'sir'] eyes overran mechanically. A quarter of an hour after, Conseil, approaching ['I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'me', 'you', 'sir'], said, “Is what ['I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'me', 'you', 'sir'] are reading very interesting, ['I', 'My', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'me', 'you', 'sir']?” 
 
“Very interesting!” I replied. 
 
“['I', 'sir', 'your', 'you'] should think so, ['I', 'sir', 'your', 'you']. It is ['I', 'sir', 'your', 'you'] own book ['I', 'sir', 'your', 'you'] are reading.” 
 
“My book?” 
 
And indeed ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] was holding in ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] hand the work on the Great Submarine Depths. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] did not even dream of it. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] closed the book and returned to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] walk. Ned and Conseil rose to go. 
 
“Stay here, ['my', 'I['my friends', 'them', 'us', 'we'],” said ['my', 'I'], detaining ['my friends', 'them', 'us', 'we']. “Let ['my friends', 'them', 'us', 'we'] remain together until ['my friends', 'them', 'us', 'we'] are out of this block.” 
 
“As ['you', 'sir'] please, ['you', 'sir'],” Conseil replied. 
 
Some hours passed. ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'I'] often looked at the instruments hanging from the partition. The manometer showed that the _Nautilus_ kept at a constant depth of more than three hundred yards; the compass still pointed to south; the log indicated a speed of twenty miles an hour, which, in such a cramped space, was very great. But ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'the Captain', 'him'] knew that ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'the Captain', 'him'] could not hasten too much, and that minutes were worth ages to us. At twenty-five minutes past eight a second shock took place, this time from behind. ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'I'] turned pale. ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'I'] companions were close by ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'I'] side. ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'I'] seized Conseil’s hand. ['Our', 'our'] looks expressed ['Our', 'our'] feelings better than words. At this moment ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'the Captain', 'him'] entered the saloon. ['I', 'I', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'I'] went up to ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'the Captain', 'him']. 
 
“Our course is barred southward?” I asked. 
 
“Yes, sir. The iceberg has shifted and closed every outlet.” 
 
“We are blocked up then?” 
 
“Yes.” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XVI WANT OF AIR 
 
Thus around the _Nautilus_, above and below, was an impenetrable wall of ice. We were prisoners to the iceberg. I watched ['the Captain', 'His']. ['the Captain', 'Hi['His countenance', 'its'] had resumed ['His countenance', 'its'] habitual imperturbability. 
 
“Gentlemen,” ['he', 'I'] said calmly, “there are two ways of dying in the circumstances in which we are placed.” (This puzzling person had the air of ['a mathematical professor lecturing to his pupil['a mathematical professor lecturing to his pupils', 'his'] 'his'].) “The first is to be crushed; the second is to die of suffocation. ['he', 'I'] do not speak of the possibility of dying of hunger, for the supply of provisions in the _Nautilus_ will certainly last longer than we shall. Let ['us', 'our'], then, calculate ['us', 'our'] chances.” 
 
“As to ['suffocation', 'that'], Captain,” I replied, “['suffocation', 'that'] is not to be feared, because our reservoirs are full.” 
 
“Just so; but they will only yield two days’ supply of air. Now, for thirty-six hours ['we', 'our'] have been hidden under the water, and already the heavy atmosphere of the _Nautilus_ requires renewal. In forty-eight hours ['we', 'our'] reserve will be exhausted.” 
 
“Well, Captain, can we be delivered before forty-eight hours?” 
 
“['We', 'us'] will attempt it, at least, by piercing the wall that surrounds ['We', 'us'].” 
 
“On which side?” 
 
“Sound will tell us. ['I', 'my'] am going to run the _Nautilus_ aground on the lower bank, and ['I', 'my'] men will attack the iceberg on the side that is least thick.” 
 
Captain Nemo went out. Soon I discovered by a hissing noise that the water was entering the reservoirs. The _Nautilus_ sank slowly, and rested on the ice at a depth of 350 yards, the depth at which the lower bank was immersed. 
 
“['My', 'I', 'I['My friends', 'your'],” ['My', 'I', 'I'] said, “our situation is serious, but ['My', 'I', 'I'] rely on ['My friends', 'your'] courage and energy.” 
 
“Sir,” replied ['the Canadian', 'I'], “['the Canadian', 'I'] am ready to do anything for the general safety.” 
 
“Good! Ned,” and ['I', 'my'] held out ['I', 'my'] hand to the Canadian. 
 
“['I', 'he', 'I', 'my'] will add,” ['I', 'he', 'I', 'my'] continued, “that, being as handy with the pickaxe as with the harpoon, if ['I', 'he', 'I', 'my'] can be useful to ['the Captain', 'he'], ['the Captain', 'he'] can command ['I', 'he', 'I', 'my'] services.” 
 
“He will not refuse ['your', 'Ned'] help. Come, ['your', 'Ned']!” 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] led ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned'] to ['the room where the crew of the _Nautilus_ were putting on their cork-jack['the crew of the _Nautilus_', 'their['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it']here the panes of['the crew of the _Nautilus_', 'their', 'the crew']s were open']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] told ['the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] of ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned'] proposal, which ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned'] accepted. ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned'] put on ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned'] sea-costume, and was ready as soon as ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned'] companions. When ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned'] was dressed, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] re-entered ['the room where the crew of the _Nautilus_ were putting on their cork-jackets', 'the drawing-room, where the panes of glass were open'], and, posted near ['Conseil', 'Conseil'], ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] examined the ambient beds that supported ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it']. Some instants after, ['we', 'us', 'we'] saw ['a dozen of the crew', 'them',['the crew of the _Nautilus_', 'their', 'the crew'] set foot on the bank of ice, and among ['a dozen of the crew', 'them', 'them'] ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'h['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned'], 'Ned']. ['the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] was with ['a dozen of the crew', 'them', 'them']. Before proceeding to dig the walls, ['the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] took the soundings, to be sure of working in the right direction. ['Long sounding lines', 'they'] were sunk in the side walls, but after fifteen yards ['Long sounding lines', 'they'] were again stopped by ['the thick wall', 'it']. It was useless to attack ['the thick wall', 'it'] on the ceiling-like surface, since ['the iceberg itself', 'itself', 'the ice['the iceberg itself', 'itself', 'the iceberg'] measured more than 400 yards in height. ['the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] then sounded the lower surface. There ten yards of wall separated ['we', 'us', 'we'] from ['the water', 'The water'], so great was the thickness of ['the ice-field', 'it', 'the ice-field']. It was necessary, therefore, to cut from ['the ice-field', 'it', 'the ice-field'] a piece equal in extent to the waterline of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it']. There were about 6,000 cubic yards to detach, so as to dig a hole by which ['we', 'us', 'we'] could descend to ['the ice-field', 'it', 'the ice-field']. The work had begun immediately and carried on with indefatigable energy. Instead of digging round ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] which would have involved greater difficulty, ['the Captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] had ['an immense trench made at eight yards from the port-quarter', 'its', 'this compact matter', 'the mass']. Then ['the men', 'their'] set to work simultaneously with ['the men', 'their'] screws on several points of ['an immense trench made at eight yards from the port-quarter', 'its', 'this compact matter', 'the mass'] circumference. Presently ['the pickaxe', 'the pickaxe'] attacked ['an immense trench made at eight yards from the port-quarter', 'its', 'this compact matter', 'the mass'] vigorously, and large blocks were detached from ['an immense trench made at eight yards from the port-quarter', 'its', 'this compact matter', 'the mass']. By a curious effect of specific gravity, these blocks, lighter than water, ['fled', 'that'], so to speak, to the vault of the tunnel, that increased in thickness at the top in proportion as it diminished at the base. But ['fled', 'that'] mattered little, so long as the lower part grew thinner. After two hours’ hard work, ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned'] came in exhausted. ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned['He and his comrades', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we', ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned']r', 'We'] were replaced by new workers, whom ['Conseil', 'Conseil'] and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] joined. The second lieutenant of the _Nautilus_ superintended ['He and his comrades', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'We']. ['the water', 'The water'] seemed singularly cold, but ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] soon got warm handling ['the pickaxe', 'the pickaxe']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me['My movements', 'they'] were free enough, although ['My movements', 'they'] were made under a pressure of thirty atmospheres. When ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] re-entered, after working two hours, to take some food and rest, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] found a perceptible difference between the pure fluid with which the Rouquayrol engine supplied ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me'] and the atmosphere of the _Nautilus_, already charged with carbonic acid. ['The air', 'its'] had not been renewed for forty-eight hours, and ['The air', 'its'] vivifying qualities were considerably enfeebled. However, after a lapse of twelve hours, ['He and his comrades', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'We'] had only ['raised', 'this much'] a block of ice one yard thick, on the marked surface, which was about 600 cubic yards! Reckoning that it took twelve hours to accomplish ['raised', 'this much'] it would take five nights and four days to bring this enterprise to a satisfactory conclusion. Five nights and four days! And ['He and his comrades', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'We'] have only air enough for two days in the reservoirs! “Without taking into account,” said ['him', 'Ned’s', 'he', 'The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'Ned', 'Ned Land, easily known by his stature', 'his', 'Ned Land', 'He', 'his', 'Ned'], “that, even if ['He and his comrades', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'We'] get out of this infernal prison, ['He and his comrades', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'We'] shall also be imprisoned under ['the iceberg itself', 'itself', 'the iceberg'], shut out from all possible communication with the atmosphere.” True enough! Who could then foresee the minimum of time necessary for ['He and his comrades', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'We'] deliverance? ['He and his comrades', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'our', 'We'] might be suffocated before ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] could regain the surface of the waves? Was ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] destined to perish in this ice-tomb, with all those ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] enclosed? The situation was terrible. But everyone had looked the danger in the face, and ['each', 'his'] was determined to do ['each', 'his'] duty to the last. 
 
As ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] expected, during the night a new block a yard square was carried away, and still further sank ['the immense hollow', 'the slushy mass']. But in the morning when, dressed in ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] cork-jacket, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] traversed ['the immense hollow', 'the slushy mass'] at a temperature of six or seven degrees below zero, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] remarked that the side walls were gradually closing in. The beds of water farthest from the trench, that were not warmed by the men’s work, showed a tendency to ['solidification', 'this new and imminent danger']. In presence of ['solidification', 'this new and imminent danger'], what would become of our chances of safety, and how hinder the solidification of this liquid medium, that would burst the partitions of the _Nautilus_ like glass? 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] did not tell ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I['my companions', 'they'] of ['this new danger', 'this grave complication']. What was the good of damping the energy ['my companions', 'they'] displayed in the painful work of escape? But when ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] went on board again, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I'] told Captain Nemo of ['this new danger', 'this grave complication']. 
 
“['I', 'he', 'I'] know it,” ['I', 'he', 'I'] said, in that calm tone which could counteract the most terrible apprehensions. “['It', 'it', 'it'] is one danger more; but ['I', 'he', 'I'] see no way of escaping ['It', 'it', 'it']; the only chance of safety is to go quicker than solidification. We must ['be', 'that'] beforehand with ['It', 'it', 'it'], ['be', 'that'] is all.” 
 
On this day for several hours ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] used ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] pickaxe vigorously. The work kept ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] up. Besides, to work was to quit ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus', 'the iceberg', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_'], and breathe directly the pure air drawn from ['the reservoirs', 'his reservoirs'], and supplied by ['our', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'we'] apparatus, and to quit the impoverished and vitiated atmosphere. Towards evening the trench was dug one yard deeper. When ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] returned on ['board', 'board', 'board'], ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] was nearly suffocated by ['the carbonic acid with which the air was filled', 'this deleterious gas']—ah! if ['our', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'we'] had only the chemical means to drive away ['the carbonic acid with which the air was filled', 'this deleterious gas']. ['our', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'we'] had plenty of oxygen; ['all this water', 'it'] contained a considerable quantity, and by ['dissolving', 'it'] ['all this water', 'it'] with ['our', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'we'] powerful piles, ['dissolving', 'it'] would restore the vivifying fluid. ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] had thought well over it; but of what good was that, since ['the carbonic acid produced by our resp['our', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'we']tion', 'it'] had invaded every part of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus', 'the iceberg', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_']? To absorb ['the carbonic acid produced by our respiration', 'it'], it was necessary to fill ['some jars', 'them'] with ['caustic potash', 'this substance', 'it'], and to shake ['some jars', 'them'] incessantly. Now ['caustic potash', 'this substance', 'it'] was wanting on ['board', 'board', 'board'], and nothing could replace ['caustic potash', 'this substance', 'it']. On that evening, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The Captain', 'him', 'him'] ought to open the taps of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The Captain', 'him', 'hi['the reservoirs', 'his reservoirs'], and let some pure air into the interior of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus', 'the iceberg', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_'];_ without this precaution ['our', 'we', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'we'] could not get rid of the sense of suffocation. The next day, March 26th, ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] resumed ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] miner’s work in beginning the fifth yard. ['The side walls and the lower surface of the iceber['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus', 'the iceberg', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_'] thickened visibly. It was evident that ['The side walls and the lower surface of the iceberg', 'they'] would meet before ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus', 'the iceberg', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_'] was able to disengage ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus', 'the iceberg', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_']. Despair seized ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] for an instant; ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] pickaxe nearly fell from ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] hands. What was the good of digging if ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] must be suffocated, crushed by the water that was turning into stone?—a punishment that the ferocity of the savages even would not have invented! Just then ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The Captain', 'him', 'him'] passed near ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my']. ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] touched ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The Captain', 'him', 'him'] hand and showed ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The Captain', 'him', 'him'] the walls of our prison. The wall to port had advanced to at least four yards from the hull of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus', 'the iceberg', 'the _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'the _Nautilus_']. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The Captain', 'him', 'him'] understood ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'], and signed ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] to follow ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The Captain', 'him', 'him']. We went on ['board', 'board', 'board']. ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] took off ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] cork-jacket and accompanied ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'The Captain', 'him', 'him'] into the drawing-room. 
 
“M. Aronnax, ['we', 'we'] must attempt some desperate means, or ['we', 'we'] shall be sealed up in this solidified water as in cement.” 
 
“Yes; but what is to be done?” 
 
“Ah! if my _Nautilus_ were strong enough to bear this pressure without being crushed!” 
 
“Well?” I asked, not catching the Captain’s idea. 
 
“Do ['you', 'he', 'you', 'you'] not understand,” ['you', 'he', 'you', 'you'] replied, “that ['this congelation of water', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] will help ['us', 'us']? Do ['you', 'he', 'you', 'you'] not see that by ['this congelation of water', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] solidification, ['this congelation of water', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] would burst through this field of ice that imprisons ['us', 'us'], as, when ['this congelation of water', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] freezes, ['this congelation of water', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] bursts the hardest stones? Do ['you', 'he', 'you', 'you'] not perceive that ['this congelation of water', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] would be an agent of safety instead of destruction?” 
 
“Yes, Captain, perhaps. But, whatever resistance to crushing ['the _Nautilus', 'it']_ possesses, ['the _Nautilus', 'it'] could not support this terrible pressure, and would be flattened like an iron plate.” 
 
“I know it, sir. Therefore ['we', 'our', 'We', 'us'] must not reckon on the aid of nature, but on ['we', 'our', 'We', 'us'] own exertions. ['we', 'our', 'We', 'us'] must stop this solidification. Not only will the side walls be pressed together; but there is not ten feet of water before or behind the _Nautilus_. The congelation gains on ['we', 'our', 'We', 'us'] on all sides.” 
 
“How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on board?” 
 
The Captain looked in my face. “After to-morrow they will be empty!” 
 
A cold sweat came over ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my']. However, ought ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] to have been astonished at the answer? On March 22, the _Nautilus_ was in the open polar seas. ['We', 'we'] were at 26°. For five days ['We', 'we'] had lived on the reserve on board. And what was left of the respirable air must be kept for the workers. Even now, as ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] write, ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] recollection is still so vivid that an involuntary terror seizes ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] and ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] lungs seem to be without air. Meanwhile, ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'he', 'his'] reflected silently, and evidently ['an idea', 'it'] had struck ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'he', 'his']; but ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'he', 'his'] seemed to reject ['an idea', 'it']. At last, these words escaped ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'he', 'his'] lips: 
 
“Boiling water!” he muttered. 
 
“Boiling water?” I cried. 
 
“Yes, sir. We are enclosed in ['a space that is relatively confined', 'this part']. Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps, raise the temperature in ['a space that is relatively confined', 'this part'] and stay the congelation?” 
 
“Let us try it,” I said resolutely. 
 
“Let us try it, Professor.” 
 
['The thermometer', 'the thermometer'] then stood at 7° outside. Captain Nemo took me to the galleys, where ['the vast distillatory machines', 'They', 'these', 'the pumps', 'the machines'] stood that furnished the drinkable water by evaporation. ['the vast distillatory machines', 'They', 'these', 'the pumps', 'the machines'] filled ['the vast distillatory machines', 'They', 'these', 'the pumps', 'the machines'] with ['water', 'the liquid', 'this water', 'It', 'it'], and all the electric heat from the piles was thrown through the worms bathed in ['water', 'the liquid', 'this water', 'It', 'it']. In a few minutes ['water', 'the liquid', 'this water', 'It', 'it'] reached 100°. ['water', 'the liquid', 'this water', 'It', 'it'] was directed towards ['the vast distillatory machines', 'They', 'these', 'the pumps', 'the machines'], while fresh water replaced ['water', 'the liquid', 'this water', 'It', 'it'] in proportion. The heat developed by the troughs was such that cold water, drawn up from the sea after only having gone through ['the vast distillatory machines', 'They', 'these', 'the pumps', 'the machines'], came boiling into the body of the pump. The injection was begun, and three hours after ['The thermometer', 'the thermometer'] marked 6° below zero outside. One degree was gained. Two hours later the thermometer only marked 4°. 
 
“We shall succeed,” I said to the Captain, after having anxiously watched the result of the operation. 
 
“['I', 'he'] think,” ['I', 'he'] answered, “that ['we', 'We'] shall not be crushed. ['we', 'We'] have no more suffocation to fear.” 
 
During the night the temperature of ['the water', 'it', 'the sea-water'] rose to 1° below zero. The injections could not carry ['the water', 'it', 'the sea-water'] to a higher point. But, as the congelation of ['the water', 'it', 'the sea-water'] produces at least 2°, I was at least reassured against the dangers of solidification. 
 
['The next day, March 27th', 'this day'], six yards of ice had been cleared, twelve feet only remaining to be cleared away. There was yet forty-eight hours’ work. The air could not be renewed in the interior of the _Nautilus_. And ['The next day, March 27th', 'this day'] would make it worse. An intolerable weight ['oppressed', 'this feeling'] ['me', 'my', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I']. Towards three o’clock in the evening ['oppressed', 'this feeling'] rose to a violent degree. Yawns dislocated ['me', 'my', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] jaws. ['me', 'my', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I['My lungs', 'they'] panted as ['My lungs', 'they'] inhaled this burning fluid, which became rarefied more and more. A moral torpor took hold of ['me', 'my', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I']. ['me', 'my', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] was powerless, almost unconscious. ['me', 'my', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I['My brave Conseil', 'He', 'him', 'I', 'my', 'my master'], though exhibiting the same symptoms and suffering in the same manner, never left ['me', 'my', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I']. ['My brave Conseil', 'He', 'him', 'I', 'my', 'my master'] took ['me', 'my', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] hand and encouraged ['me', 'my', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'], and ['me', 'my', 'My', 'me', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] heard ['My brave Conseil', 'He', 'him', 'I', 'my', 'my master'] murmur, “Oh! if ['My brave Conseil', 'He', 'him', 'I', 'my', 'my master'] could only not breathe, so as to leave more air for ['My brave Conseil', 'He', 'him', 'I', 'my', 'my master['My brave Conseil', 'He', 'him', 'I', 'my', 'my master']!” 
 
Tears came into my eyes on hearing him speak thus. If ['our', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'Our', 'our', 'We', 'we'] situation to all was intolerable in the interior, with what haste and gladness would ['our', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'Our', 'our', 'We', 'we'] put on ['our', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'Our', 'our', 'We', 'we'] cork-jackets to work in ['our', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'Our', 'our', 'We', 'we'] turn! Pickaxes sounded on the frozen ice-beds. ['our', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'Our', 'our', 'We', 'we'] arms ached, the skin was torn off ['our', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'Our', 'our', 'We', 'we'] hands. But what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter? Vital air came to the lungs! ['our', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'Our', 'our', 'We', 'we'] breathed! ['our', 'we', 'our', 'our', 'Our', 'our', 'We', 'we'] breathed! 
 
All this time no one prolonged ['his', 'Hi['his voluntary task', 'His task'] beyond the prescribed time. ['his', 'Hi['his voluntary task', 'His task'] accomplished, ['each one', 'his', 'him'] handed in turn to ['each one', 'his', 'him'] panting companions ['the apparatus that supplied him with life', 'hi['each one', 'his', 'him']pparatus']. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his'] set the example, and submitted first to this severe discipline. When the time came, ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his'] gave up ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'hi['the apparatus that supplied him with life', 'his apparatus'] to another and returned to the vitiated air on board, calm, unflinching, unmurmuring. 
 
On that day the ordinary work was accomplished with unusual vigour. Only two yards remained to be raised from the surface. Two yards only separated us from the open sea. But the reservoirs were nearly emptied of air. The little that remained ought to be kept for ['the workers', 'the crew']; not a particle for the _Nautilus_. When ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'My'] went back on board, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'My'] was half suffocated. What a night! ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'My'] know not how to describe it. The next day ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'My'] breathing was oppressed. Dizziness accompanied the pain in ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'My'] head and made ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'My'] like a drunken man. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'My'] companions showed the same symptoms. Some of ['the workers', 'the crew'] had rattling in the throat. 
 
On that day, the sixth of ['our', 'us'] imprisonment, ['Captain Nemo', 'This man’s', 'him', 'He', 'his'], finding the pickaxes work too slowly, resolved to crush the ice-bed that still separated ['our', 'us'] from the liquid sheet. ['Captain Nemo', 'This man’s', 'him', 'He', 'his'] coolness and energy never forsook ['Captain Nemo', 'This man’s', 'him', 'He', 'his']. ['Captain Nemo', 'This man’s', 'him', 'He', 'his'] subdued ['Captain Nemo', 'This man’s', 'him', 'He', 'his'] physical pains by moral force. 
 
By ['his', 'his', 'he', 'himself'] orders ['the vessel', 'it', 'it', 'it'] was lightened, that is to say, raised from the ice-bed by a change of specific gravity. When ['the vessel', 'it', 'it', 'it'] floated they towed ['the vessel', 'it', 'it', 'it'] so as to bring ['the vessel', 'it', 'it', 'it'] above the immense trench made on the level of the water-line. Then, filling ['his', 'his', 'he', 'himself'] reservoirs of water, ['his', 'his', 'he', 'himself'] descended and shut ['his', 'his', 'he', 'himself'] up in the hole. 
 
Just then all the crew came on board, and the double door of communication was shut. ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] then rested on the bed of ['ice, which was not one yard thick, and which the sounding leads had perforated in a thousand places', 'The ice']. The taps of the reservoirs were then opened, and a hundred cubic yards of water was let in, increasing the weight of ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] to 1,800 tons. ['We', 'we', 'our', 'Our'] waited, ['We', 'we', 'our', 'Our'] listened, forgetting ['We', 'we', 'our', 'Our'] sufferings in hope. ['We', 'we', 'our', 'Our'] safety depended on this last chance. Notwithstanding the buzzing in ['my', 'I'] head, ['my', 'I'] soon heard the humming sound under the hull of ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_']. ['ice, which was not one yard thick, and which the sounding leads had perforated in a thousand places', 'The ice'] cracked with a singular noise, like tearing paper, and ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] sank. 
 
“We are off!” murmured Conseil in my ear. 
 
['I', 'I', 'I'] could not answer ['him', 'his']. ['I', 'I', 'I'] seized ['him', 'hi['his hand', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'], and pressed ['his hand', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] convulsively. All at once, carried away by ['his hand', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] frightful overcharge, ['his hand', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] sank like a bullet under the waters, that is to say, ['his hand', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] fell as if ['his hand', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] was in a vacuum. Then all the electric force was put on the pumps, that soon began to let the water out of the reservoirs. After some minutes, ['our', 'us', 'we'] fall was stopped. Soon, too, the manometer indicated an ascending movement. The screw, going at full speed, made ['the iron hull', 'its'] tremble to ['the iron hull', 'its'] very bolts and drew ['our', 'us', 'we'] towards the north. But if this floating under the iceberg is to last another day before ['our', 'us', 'we'] reach the open sea, ['I', 'I', 'I'] shall be dead first. 
 
Half stretched upon a divan in the library, ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was suffocating. ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] face was purple, ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] lips blue, ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] faculties suspended. ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] neither saw nor heard. All notion of time had gone from ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] mind. ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] muscles could not contract. ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] do not know how many hours passed thus, but ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was conscious of the agony that was coming over ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I']. ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] felt as if ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was going to die. Suddenly ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] came to. Some breaths of air penetrated ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] lungs. Had ['we', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] risen to the surface of the waves? Were ['we', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] free of the iceberg? No! ['Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends', 'themselves', 'they', 'th['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I']', 'they', 'they'], were sacrificing ['Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends', 'themselves', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'they'] to save ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I']. ['Some particles of air', 'it', 'it'] still remained at the bottom of ['one apparatus', 'the thing']. Instead of using ['Some particles of air', 'it', 'it'], ['Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends', 'themselves', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'they'] had kept ['Some particles of air', 'it', 'it'] for ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'], and, while ['Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends', 'themselves', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'they'] were being suffocated, ['Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends', 'themselves', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'they'] gave ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] life, drop by drop. ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] wanted to push back ['one apparatus', 'the thing']; ['Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends', 'themselves', 'they', 'they', 'they', 'they'] held ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] hands, and for some moments ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] breathed freely. ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] looked at the clock; it was eleven in the morning. It ought to be the 28th of March. ['The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_'] went at a frightful pace, forty miles an hour. ['The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_'] literally tore through the water. Where was ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his', 'him']? Had ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his', 'him'] succumbed? Were ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his', 'him'] companions dead with ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'his', 'him']? At the moment the manometer indicated that ['we', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] were not more than twenty feet from the surface. ['A mere plate of ice', 'it'] separated ['we', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] from the atmosphere. Could ['we', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] not ['break', 'it'] ['A mere plate of ice', 'it']? Perhaps. In any case ['The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_'] was going to attempt ['break', 'it']. ['I', 'My', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] felt that ['The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_'] was in an oblique position, lowering the stern, and raising the bows. The introduction of water had been the means of disturbing ['The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_'] equilibrium. Then, impelled by ['The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_'] powerful screw, ['The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_'] attacked ['the ice-field', 'it', 'the field, which gradually gave way', 'it', 'the ice-field, that crushed beneath its weight', 'its'] from beneath like a formidable battering-ram. ['The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_'] broke ['the ice-field', 'it', 'the field, which gradually gave way', 'it', 'the ice-field, that crushed beneath its weight', 'its'] by backing and then rushing forward against ['the ice-field', 'it', 'the field, which gradually gave way', 'it', 'the ice-field, that crushed beneath its weight', 'its']; and at last, dashing suddenly against ['the ice-field', 'it', 'the field, which gradually gave way', 'it', 'the ice-field, that crushed beneath its weight', 'its'], shot forwards on ['the ice-field', 'it', 'the field, which gradually gave way', 'it', 'the ice-field, that crushed beneath its weigh['the ice-field', 'it', 'the field, which gradually gave way', 'it', 'the ice-field, that crushed beneath its weight', 'its'] 'its']. The panel was opened—one might say torn off—and the pure air came in in abundance to all parts of ['The _Nautilus_', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'its', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_']. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XVII FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON 
 
How ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] got on to the platform, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] have no idea; perhaps the Canadian had carried ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] there. But ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] breathed, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] inhaled ['the vivifying sea-air', 'this air']. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My'] two companions were getting drunk with the fresh particles. ['The other unhappy men', 'they', 'them'] had been so long without food, that ['The other unhappy men', 'they', 'them'] could not with impunity indulge in the simplest aliments that were given ['The other unhappy men', 'they', 'them']. ['We', 'ourselves', 'we', 'our', 'us'], on the contrary, had no end to restrain ['We', 'ourselves', 'we', 'our', 'us']; ['We', 'ourselves', 'we', 'our', 'us'] could draw ['the vivifying sea-air', 'this air'] freely into ['We', 'ourselves', 'we', 'our', 'us'] lungs, and it was the breeze, the breeze alone, that filled ['We', 'ourselves', 'we', 'our', 'us'] with this keen enjoyment. 
 
“Ah!” said Conseil, “how delightful ['this oxygen', 'it'] is! Master need not fear to breathe ['this oxygen', 'it']. There is enough for everybody.” 
 
['Ned Land', 'he', 'his'] did not speak, but ['Ned Land', 'he', 'his'] opened ['Ned Land', 'he', 'his'] jaws wide enough to frighten a shark. ['Our', 'we'] strength soon returned, and, when ['I', 'me', 'I'] looked round ['I', 'me', 'I'], ['I', 'me', 'I'] saw ['Our', 'we'] were alone on the platform. ['The foreign seamen in the _Nautilus_', 'them'] were contented with the air that circulated in the interior; none of ['The foreign seamen in the _Nautilus_', 'them'] had come to drink in the open air. 
 
The first words ['I', 'my', 'my', 'my'] spoke were words of gratitude and thankfulness to ['I', 'my', 'my', 'my['my two companions', 'Ned and Conseil']. ['my two companions', 'Ned and Conseil'] had prolonged ['I', 'my', 'my', 'my'] life during the last hours of this long agony. All ['I', 'my', 'my', 'my'] gratitude could not repay such devotion. 
 
“['My', 'I', 'I['My friends', 'you'],” said ['My', 'I', 'I'], “we are bound one to the other for ever, and ['My', 'I', 'I'] am under infinite obligations to ['My friends', 'you'].” 
 
“Which ['I', 'the Canadian'] shall take advantage of,” exclaimed ['I', 'the Canadian']. 
 
“What do you mean?” said Conseil. 
 
“['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] mean that ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] shall take you with ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] when ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] leave this infernal _Nautilus_.” 
 
“Well,” said Conseil, “after all this, are we going right?” 
 
“Yes,” I replied, “for we are going the way of ['the sun', 'the sun'], and here ['the sun', 'the sun'] is in the north.” 
 
“No doubt,” said Ned Land; “but it remains to be seen whether he will bring the ship into the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean, that is, into frequented or deserted seas.” 
 
['I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could not answer that question, and ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] feared that ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'Captain Nemo'] would rather take ['us', 'We', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'our'] to the vast ocean that touches the coasts of Asia and America at the same time. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'Captain Nemo'] would thus complete the tour round the submarine world, and return to those waters in which ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'] could sail freely. ['us', 'We', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'our'] ought, before long, to settle ['this important point', 'the American point']. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'] went at a rapid pace. The polar circle was soon passed, and the course shaped for Cape Horn. ['us', 'We', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'our'] were off ['this important point', 'the American point'], March 31st, at seven o’clock in the evening. Then all ['us', 'We', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'our'] past sufferings were forgotten. The remembrance of that imprisonment in the ice was effaced from ['us', 'We', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'our'] minds. ['us', 'We', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'our'] only thought of the future. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'Captain Nemo'] did not appear again either in ['the drawing-room', 'the drawing-room'] or on ['the platform', 'the platform']. The point shown each day on the planisphere, and, marked by the lieutenant, showed ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] the exact direction of ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it']. Now, on that evening, it was evident, to, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] great satisfaction, that ['us', 'We', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'our'] were going back to the North by the Atlantic. The next day, April 1st, when ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'] ascended to the surface some minutes before noon, ['us', 'We', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'our'] sighted ['land to the west', 'It']. ['land to the west', 'It'] was Terra del Fuego, which the first navigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that rose from the natives’ huts. ['The coast', 'the coast, which was only some few miles off'] seemed low to ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'], but in the distance rose high mountains. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] even thought ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] had a glimpse of Mount Sarmiento, that rises 2,070 yards above the level of ['the sea', 'the open polar sea', 'the sea'], with ['a very pointed summit, which, according as it is misty or clear, is a sign of fine or of wet weather', 'the peak']. At this moment ['a very pointed summit, which, according as it is misty or clear, is a sign of fine or of wet weather', 'the peak'] was clearly defined against the sky. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'], diving again under the water, approached ['The coast', 'the coast, which was only some few miles off']. From the glass windows in ['the drawing-room', 'the drawing-room'], ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw long seaweeds and gigantic fuci and varech, of which ['the sea', 'the open polar sea', 'the sea'] contains so many specimens, with ['their', 'they', 'they'] sharp polished filaments; ['their', 'they', 'they'] measured about 300 yards in length—real cables, thicker than one’s thumb; and, having great tenacity, ['their', 'they', 'they'] are often used as ropes for vessels. ['Another weed known as velp, with leaves four feet long, buried in the coral concretions', 'It'], hung at the bottom. ['Another weed known as velp, with leaves four feet long, buried in the coral concretions', 'It'] served as nest and food for myriads of crustacea and molluscs, crabs, and cuttlefish. There seals and otters had splendid repasts, eating the flesh of fish with sea-vegetables, according to the English fashion. Over this fertile and luxuriant ground ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'] passed with great rapidity. Towards evening ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'] approached the Falkland group, the rough summits of which ['I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] recognised the following day. The depth of ['the sea', 'the open polar sea', 'the sea'] was moderate. On the shores ['us', 'We', 'We', 'our', 'our', 'We', 'we', 'we', 'our'] nets brought in beautiful specimens of sea weed, and particularly a certain fucus, the roots of which were filled with the best mussels in the world. ['Geese and ducks', 'their'] fell by dozens on ['the platform', 'the platform'], and soon took ['Geese and ducks', 'their'] places in the pantry on board. 
 
When the last heights of the Falklands had disappeared from the horizon, ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'Its'] sank to between twenty and twenty-five yards, and followed the American coast. ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo'] did not show ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo']. Until the 3rd of April ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us'] did not quit the shores of Patagonia, sometimes under the ocean, sometimes at the surface. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'Its'] passed beyond the large estuary formed by the Uraguay. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'Its'] direction was northwards, and followed the long windings of the coast of South America. ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us'] had then made 1,600 miles since ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us'] embarkation in the seas of Japan. About eleven o’clock in the morning the Tropic of Capricorn was crossed on the thirty-seventh meridian, and ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us'] passed Cape Frio standing out to sea. ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo'], to Ned Land’s great displeasure, did not like the neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of Brazil, for ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us'] went at a giddy speed. Not a fish, not a bird of the swiftest kind could follow ['we', 'We', 'our', 'we', 'we', 'us'], and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped all observation. 
 
This speed was kept up for several days, and in the evening of the 9th of April we sighted the most westerly point of South America that forms ['Cape San Roque', 'this Cape']. But then ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] swerved again, and sought the lowest depth of ['a submarine valley which is between this Cape and Sierra Leone on the African coast', 'Thi['Cape San Roque', 'this Cape'], 'this place', 'this immense valley']. ['a submarine valley which is between this Cape and Sierra Leone on the African coast', 'This valley', 'this place', 'this immense valley'] bifurcates to the parallel of ['the Antilles', 'the Lesser Antilles'], and terminates at the mouth by the enormous depression of 9,000 yards. In ['a submarine valley which is between this Cape and Sierra Leone on the African coast', 'This valley', 'this place', 'this immense valley'], the geological basin of the ocean forms, as far as ['the Antilles', 'the Lesser Antilles'], a cliff to three and a half miles perpendicular in height, and, at the parallel of the Cape Verde Islands, an other wall not less considerable, that encloses thus all the sunk continent of the Atlantic. The bottom of ['a submarine valley which is between this Cape and Sierra Leone on the African coast', 'This valley', 'this place', 'this immense valley'] is dotted with some mountains, that give to these submarine places a picturesque aspect. I speak, moreover, from the manuscript charts that were in the library of the _Nautilus_—charts evidently due to ['Captain Nemo’s', 'his'] hand, and made after ['Captain Nemo’s', 'his'] personal observations. For two days the desert and deep waters were visited by means of the inclined planes. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] was furnished with long diagonal broadsides which carried ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] to all elevations. But on the 11th of April ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it'] rose suddenly, and land appeared at the mouth of the Amazon River, a vast estuary, the embouchure of which is so considerable that it freshens the sea-water for the distance of several leagues. 
 
The equator was crossed. Twenty miles to the west were the Guianas, a French territory, on which we could have found an easy refuge; but a stiff breeze was blowing, and the furious waves would not have allowed a single boat to face them. ['Ned Land', 'he', 'his', 'him'] understood ['that', 'it'], no doubt, for ['Ned Land', 'he', 'his', 'him'] spoke not a word about ['that', 'it']. For ['my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] part, ['my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] made no allusion to ['Ned Land', 'he', 'his', 'him'] schemes of flight, for ['my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] would not urge ['Ned Land', 'he', 'his', 'him'] to make an attempt that must inevitably fail. ['my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] made the time pass pleasantly by interesting studies. During the days of April 11th and 12th, the _Nautilus_ did not leave the surface of ['the sea', 'the ocean'], and the net brought in a marvellous haul of Zoophytes, fish and reptiles. ['Some zoophytes', 'they'] had been fished up by the chain of the nets; ['Some zoophytes', 'they'] were for the most part beautiful phyctallines, belonging to the actinidian family, and among other species the phyctalis protexta, peculiar to that part of ['the sea', 'the ocean'], with a little cylindrical trunk, ornamented With vertical lines, speckled with red dots, crowning a marvellous blossoming of tentacles. As to ['the molluscs', 'they'], ['the molluscs', 'they'] consisted of some ['my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] had already observed—turritellas, olive porphyras, with regular lines intercrossed, with red spots standing out plainly against the flesh; odd pteroceras, like petrified scorpions; translucid hyaleas, argonauts, cuttle-fish (excellent eating), and certain species of calmars that naturalists of antiquity have classed amongst the flying-fish, and that serve principally for bait for cod-fishing. ['my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] had now an opportunity of studying several species of fish on these shores. Amongst the cartilaginous ones, petromyzons-pricka, a sort of eel, fifteen inches long, with a greenish head, violet fins, grey-blue back, brown belly, silvered and sown with bright spots, the pupil of the eye encircled with gold—a curious animal, that the current of the Amazon had drawn to the sea, for they inhabit fresh waters—tuberculated streaks, with pointed snouts, and a long loose tail, armed with a long jagged sting; little sharks, a yard long, grey and whitish skin, and several rows of teeth, bent back, that are generally known by the name of pantouffles; vespertilios, a kind of red isosceles triangle, half a yard long, to which ['pectorals', 'them', 'their', 'them'] are attached by fleshy prolongations that make ['pectorals', 'them', 'their', 'them'] look like bats, but that ['pectorals', 'them', 'their', 'them'] horny appendage, situated near the nostrils, has given ['pectorals', 'them', 'their', 'them'] the name of sea-unicorns; lastly, some species of balistae, the curassavian, whose spots were of a brilliant gold colour, and the capriscus of clear violet, and with varying shades like a pigeon’s throat. 
 
['I', 'I'] end here this catalogue, which is somewhat dry perhaps, but very exact, with a series of bony fish that ['I', 'I'] observed in passing belonging to the apteronotes, and whose snout is white as snow, the body of a beautiful black, marked with a very long loose fleshy strip; odontognathes, armed with spikes; sardines nine inches long, glittering with a bright silver light; a species of mackerel provided with two anal fins; centronotes of a blackish tint, that are fished for with torches, long fish, two yards in length, with fat flesh, white and firm, which, when they arc fresh, taste like eel, and when dry, like smoked salmon; labres, half red, covered with scales only at the bottom of the dorsal and anal fins; chrysoptera, on which ['gold and silver', 'their'] blend ['gold and silver', 'their'] brightness with that of the ruby and topaz; ['golden-tailed spares, the flesh of which is extremely delicate, and whose phosphorescent properties betray them in th['golden-tailed spares, the flesh of which is extremely delicate, and whose phosphorescent properties betray them in the midst of the waters', 'them']dst of the waters', 'them']; orange-coloured spares with long tongues; maigres, with gold caudal fins, dark thorn-tails, anableps of Surinam, etc. 
 
Notwithstanding this “et cetera,” ['I', 'I'] must not omit to mention fish that ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'his'] will long remember, and with good reason. One of our nets had hauled up ['a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off, formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces', 'It', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'the fish', 'it', 'it']. ['a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off, formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces', 'It', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'the fish', 'it', 'it'] was white underneath, red above, with large round spots of dark blue encircled with black, very glossy skin, terminating in a bilobed fin. Laid out on the platform, ['a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off, formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces', 'It', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'the fish', 'it', 'it'] struggled, tried to turn ['a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off, formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces', 'It', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'the fish', 'it', 'it'] by convulsive movements, and made so many efforts, that one last turn had nearly sent ['a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off, formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces', 'It', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'the fish', 'it', 'it'] into the sea. But ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'his'], not wishing to let ['a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off, formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces', 'It', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'the fish', 'it', 'it'] go, rushed to ['a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off, formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces', 'It', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'the fish', 'it', 'it'], and, before ['I', 'I'] could prevent ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'his'], had seized ['a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off, formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces', 'It', 'it', 'itself', 'it', 'the fish', 'it', 'it'] with both hands. In a moment ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'his'] was overthrown, ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'his'] legs in the air, and half ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'him', 'he', 'his', 'his'] body paralysed, crying— 
 
“Oh! master, master! help me!” 
 
It was the first time ['the poor boy', 'him', 'his', 'he'] had spoken to ['me', 'I', 'I'] so familiarly. The Canadian and ['me', 'I', 'I'] took ['the poor boy', 'him', 'his', 'he'] up, and rubbed ['the poor boy', 'him', 'his', 'he'] contracted arms till ['the poor boy', 'him', 'his', 'he'] became sensible. ['The unfortunate Conseil', 'Conseil'] had attacked a cramp-fish of the most dangerous kind, the cumana. ['This odd animal', 'its'], in a medium conductor like water, strikes fish at several yards’ distance, so great is the power of ['This odd animal', 'its'] electric organ, the two principal surfaces of which do not measure less than twenty-seven square feet. The next day, April 12th, the _Nautilus_ approached the Dutch coast, near the mouth of the Maroni. There ['several groups of sea-cows', 'they', 'These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from eighteen to twenty-one feet in length', 'these mammalia', 'they'] herded together; ['several groups of sea-cows', 'they', 'These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from eighteen to twenty-one feet in length', 'these mammalia', 'they'] were manatees, that, like the dugong and the stellera, belong to the skenian order. ['several groups of sea-cows', 'they', 'These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from eighteen to twenty-one feet in length', 'these mammalia', 'they'], weigh at least sixteen hundredweight. ['me', 'I', 'I'] told Ned Land and ['The unfortunate Conseil', 'Conseil'] that provident nature had assigned an important role to ['several groups of sea-cows', 'they', 'These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from eighteen to twenty-one feet in length', 'these mammalia', 'they']. Indeed, ['several groups of sea-cows', 'they', 'These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from eighteen to twenty-one feet in length', 'these mammalia', 'they'], like the seals, are designed to graze on the submarine prairies, and thus destroy the accumulation of weed that obstructs the tropical rivers. 
 
“And do you know,” I added, “what has been the result since men have almost entirely annihilated this useful race? That the putrefied weeds have poisoned ['the air', 'the poisoned air'], and ['the air', 'the poisoned air'] causes the yellow fever, that desolates these beautiful countries. Enormous vegetations are multiplied under the torrid seas, and the evil is irresistibly developed from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to Florida. If we are to believe Toussenel, ['this plague', 'it'] is nothing to what ['this plague', 'it'] would be if the seas were cleaned of ['whales and seals', 'they', 'their']. Then, infested with poulps, medusæ, and cuttle-fish, ['whales and seals', 'they', 'their'] would become immense centres of infection, since ['whales and seals', 'they', 'their'] waves would not possess ‘these vast stomachs that God had charged to infest the surface of the seas.’” 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XVIII THE POULPS 
 
For several days ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] kept off from the American coast. Evidently ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] did not wish to risk the tides of ['the Gulf of Mexico', 'the Gulf'] or of the sea of the Antilles. April 16th, we sighted ['Martinique and Guadaloupe', 'their'] from a distance of about thirty miles. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] saw ['Martinique and Guadaloupe', 'their'] tall peaks for an instant. The Canadian, who counted on carrying out his projects in ['the Gulf of Mexico', 'the Gulf'], by either landing or hailing ['one of the numerous boats that coast from one island to another', 'the boat'], was quite disheartened. Flight would have been quite practicable, if ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'Ned Land'] had been able to ['take', 'it'] possession of ['one of the numerous boats that coast from one island to another', 'the boat'] without ['the Captain’s', 'the Captain of the _Nautilus_', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'him'] knowledge. But in the open sea ['take', 'it'] could not be thought of. ['The Canadian, Conseil, and I', 'we', 'We', 'We', 'ourselves'['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] had a long conversation on this subject. For six months ['The Canadian, Conseil, and I', 'we', 'We', 'We', 'ourselves'] had been prisoners on board ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_']. ['The Canadian, Conseil, and I', 'we', 'We', 'We', 'ourselves'] had travelled 17,000 leagues; and, as ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'Ned Land'] said, there was no reason why it should come to an end. ['The Canadian, Conseil, and I', 'we', 'We', 'We', 'ourselves'] could hope nothing from ['the Captain’s', 'the Captain of the _Nautilus_', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'him'], but only from ['The Canadian, Conseil, and I', 'we', 'We', 'We', 'ourselves']. Besides, for some time past ['the Captain’s', 'the Captain of the _Nautilus_', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'him'] had become graver, more retired, less sociable. ['the Captain’s', 'the Captain of the _Nautilus_', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'him'] seemed to shun ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my']. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] met ['the Captain’s', 'the Captain of the _Nautilus_', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'him'] rarely. Formerly ['the Captain’s', 'the Captain of the _Nautilus_', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'him'] was pleased to explain the submarine marvels to ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my']; now ['the Captain’s', 'the Captain of the _Nautilus_', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'him'] left ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] to ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] studies, and came no more to the saloon. What change had come over ['the Captain’s', 'the Captain of the _Nautilus_', 'he', 'He', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'him']? For what cause? For ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] part, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] did not wish to bury with ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] curious and novel studies. ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] had now the power to write ['the true book of the sea', 'this book']; and ['the true book of the sea', 'this book'], sooner or later, ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] wished to see daylight. The land nearest us was the archipelago of the Bahamas. There rose high submarine cliffs covered with large weeds. It was about eleven o’clock when ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'Ned Land'] drew ['I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] attention to a formidable pricking, like the sting of an ant, which was produced by means of large seaweeds. 
 
“Well,” ['I', 'I'] said, “these are proper caverns for poulps, and ['I', 'I'] should not be astonished to see some of these monsters.” 
 
“What!” said Conseil; “cuttlefish, real cuttlefish of the cephalopod class?” 
 
“No,” I said, “poulps of huge dimensions.” 
 
“['I', 'Ned'] will never believe that such animals exist,” said ['I', 'Ned']. 
 
“Well,” said ['Conseil', 'I'], with the most serious air in the world, “['Conseil', 'I'] remember perfectly to have seen a large vessel drawn under the waves by an octopus’s arm.” 
 
“['You', 'the Canadian'] saw that?” said ['You', 'the Canadian']. 
 
“Yes, Ned.” 
 
“With your own eyes?” 
 
“With my own eyes.” 
 
“Where, pray, might that be?” 
 
“At St. Malo,” answered Conseil. 
 
“In the port?” said Ned, ironically. 
 
“No; in a church,” replied Conseil. 
 
“In a church!” cried the Canadian. 
 
“Yes; friend Ned. In a picture representing the poulp in question.” 
 
“Good!” said Ned Land, bursting out laughing. 
 
“He is quite right,” ['I', 'I'] said. “['I', 'I'] have heard of this picture; but the subject represented is taken from a legend, and you know what to think of legends in the matter of natural history. Besides, when it is a question of monsters, the imagination is apt to run wild. Not only is it supposed that these poulps can draw down vessels, but a certain Olaus Magnus speaks of an octopus a mile long that is more like an island than an animal. It is also said that the Bishop of Nidros was building an altar on ['an immense rock', 'the rock', 'The rock']. Mass finished, ['an immense rock', 'the rock', 'The rock'] began to walk, and returned to the sea. ['an immense rock', 'the rock', 'The rock'] was a poulp. Another Bishop, Pontoppidan, speaks also of a poulp on which a regiment of cavalry could manœuvre. Lastly, the ancient naturalists speak of monsters whose mouths were like gulfs, and which were too large to pass through the Straits of Gibraltar.” 
 
“But how much is true of these stories?” asked Conseil. 
 
“Nothing, my friends; at least of that which passes the limit of truth to get to fable or legend. Nevertheless, there must be some ground for the imagination of the story-tellers. One cannot deny that poulps and cuttlefish exist of a large species, inferior, however, to the cetaceans. Aristotle has stated the dimensions of a cuttlefish as five cubits, or nine feet two inches. Our fishermen frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of ['poulps', 'these animals'] are preserved in the museums of Trieste and Montpelier, that measure two yards in length. Besides, according to the calculations of some naturalists, one of ['poulps', 'these animals'] only six feet long would have ['tentacles twenty-seven feet long', 'That']. ['tentacles twenty-seven feet long', 'That'] would suffice to make a formidable monster.” 
 
“Do they fish for them in these days?” asked Ned. 
 
“If ['they', 'sailors'] do not fish for ['them', 'them', 'these monsters of colossal dimensions', 'these gigantic animals'], ['they', 'sailors'] see ['them', 'them', 'these monsters of colossal dimensions', 'these gigantic animals'] at least. ['One of my friends, Captain Paul Bos of Havre', 'he'], has often affirmed that ['One of my friends, Captain Paul Bos of Havre', 'he'] met one of ['them', 'them', 'these monsters of colossal dimensions', 'these gigantic animals'] in the Indian seas. But the most astonishing fact, and which does not permit of the denial of the existence of ['them', 'them', 'these monsters of colossal dimensions', 'these gigantic animals'], happened some years ago, in 1861.” 
 
“What is the fact?” asked Ned Land. 
 
“This is it. In 1861, to the north-east of Teneriffe, very nearly in the same latitude we are in now, ['the crew of the despatch-boat Alector', 'the crew', 'They'] perceived ['a monstrous cuttlefish', 'the animal', 'it', 'the mollusc', 'it', 'its', 'this ornament', 'he'] swimming in the waters. Captain Bouguer went near to ['a monstrous cuttlefish', 'the animal', 'it', 'the mollusc', 'it', 'its', 'this ornament', 'he'], and attacked ['a monstrous cuttlefish', 'the animal', 'it', 'the mollusc', 'it', 'its', 'this ornament', 'he'] with harpoon and guns, without much success, for balls and harpoons glided over the soft flesh. After several fruitless attempts ['the crew of the despatch-boat Alector', 'the crew', 'They'] tried to pass a slip-knot round ['the body of the mollusc', ['a monstrous cuttlefish', 'the animal', 'it', 'the mollusc', 'it', 'its', 'this ornament', 'he']. The noose slipped as far as the tail fins and there stopped. ['the crew of the despatch-boat Alector', 'the crew', 'They'] tried then to haul ['a monstrous cuttlefish', 'the animal', 'it', 'the mollusc', 'it', 'its', 'this ornament', 'he'] on board, but ['a monstrous cuttlefish', 'the animal', 'it', 'the mollusc', 'it', 'its', 'this ornament', 'he'] weight was so considerable that the tightness of the cord separated the tail from ['the body of the mollusc', 'the body'], and, deprived of ['a monstrous cuttlefish', 'the animal', 'it', 'the mollusc', 'it', 'its', 'this ornament', 'he'], ['a monstrous cuttlefish', 'the animal', 'it', 'the mollusc', 'it', 'its', 'this ornament', 'he'] disappeared under the water.” 
 
“Indeed! is that a fact?” 
 
“An indisputable fact, my good Ned. They proposed to name this poulp ‘Bouguer’s cuttlefish.’” 
 
“What length was it?” asked the Canadian. 
 
“Did it not measure about six yards?” said Conseil, who, posted at the window, was examining again the irregular windings of the cliff. 
 
“Precisely,” I replied. 
 
“['Its', 'it'] head,” rejoined Conseil, “was ['Its', 'it'] not crowned with eight tentacles, that beat the water like a nest of serpents?” 
 
“Precisely.” 
 
“Had not ['its', 'its'] eyes, placed at the back of ['its', 'its'] head, considerable development?” 
 
“Yes, Conseil.” 
 
“And was not its mouth like a parrot’s beak?” 
 
“Exactly, Conseil.” 
 
“Very well! no offence to master,” he replied, quietly; “if ['this', 'it'] is not ['Bouguer’s cuttlefish', 'its'], ['this', 'it'] is, at least, one of ['Bouguer’s cuttlefish', 'its'] brothers.” 
 
I looked at Conseil. Ned Land hurried to the window. 
 
“What a horrible beast!” he cried. 
 
['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] looked in ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] turn, and could not repress a gesture of disgust. Before ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] eyes was ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it']. ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it'] was an immense cuttlefish, being eight yards long. ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it'] swam crossways in the direction of the _Nautilus_ with great speed, watching ['us', 'us'] with ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it'] enormous staring green eyes. ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it'] eight arms, or rather feet, fixed to ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it'] head, that have given the name of cephalopod to these animals, were twice as long as ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it'] body, and were twisted like the furies’ hair. One could see the 250 air holes on the inner side of the tentacles. ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it'] mouth, a horned beak like a parrot’s, opened and shut vertically. ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it'] tongue, a horned substance, furnished with several rows of pointed teeth, came out quivering from this veritable pair of shears. What a freak of nature, a bird’s beak on a mollusc! ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it'] spindle-like body formed a fleshy mass that might weigh 4,000 to 5,000 lbs.; the, varying colour changing with great rapidity, according to the irritation of ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it'], passed successively from livid grey to reddish brown. What irritated ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it']? No doubt the presence of ['the _Nautilus_, more formidable than itself, and on which its s['the _Nautilus_, more formidable than itself, and on which its suckers or its jaws had no hold', 'itself', 'its', 'its'] or its jaws ha['the _Nautilus_, more formidable than itself, and on which its suckers or its jaws had no hold', 'itself', 'its', 'its']o hold', 'it['the _Nautilus_, more formidable than itself, and on which its suckers or its jaws had no hold', 'itself', 'its', 'its']f', 'its', 'its']. Yet, what monsters ['these poulps', 'them', 'their', 'they'] are! what vitality the Creator has given ['these poulps', 'them', 'their', 'they']! what vigour in ['these poulps', 'them', 'their', 'they'] movements! and ['these poulps', 'them', 'their', 'they'] possess three hearts! Chance had brought ['us', 'us'] in presence of ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it'], and ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] did not wish to lose the opportunity of carefully studying ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it']. ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'] overcame the horror that inspired ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'me'], and, taking a pencil, began to draw ['a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the marvellous', 'It', 'It', 'its', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'The monster’s', 'Its', 'Its', 'the animal', 'this mollusc', 'this cuttlefish', 'this specimen of cephalopods', 'it']. 
 
“Perhaps this is the same which the Alector saw,” said Conseil. 
 
“No,” replied the Canadian; “for this is whole, and ['the other', 'its'] had lost ['the other', 'its'] tail.” 
 
“That is no reason,” I replied. “The arms and tails of these animals are re-formed by renewal; and in seven years the tail of Bouguer’s cuttlefish has no doubt had time to grow.” 
 
By this time ['other poulps', 'They', 'their', 'These monsters', 'they'] appeared at the port light. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] counted seven. ['other poulps', 'They', 'their', 'These monsters', 'they'] formed a procession after ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'], and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] heard ['other poulps', 'They', 'their', 'These monsters', 'they'] beaks gnashing against the iron hull. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] continued ['I', 'I', 'I', 'my'] work. ['other poulps', 'They', 'their', 'These monsters', 'they'] kept in the water with such precision that ['other poulps', 'They', 'their', 'These monsters', 'they'] seemed immovable. Suddenly ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'] stopped. A shock made ['the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it'] tremble in every plate. 
 
“Have we struck anything?” I asked. 
 
“In any case,” replied the Canadian, “['we', 'we'] shall be free, for ['we', 'we'] are floating.” 
 
['The _Nautilus_', 'it'] was floating, no doubt, but ['The _Nautilus_', 'it'] did not move. A minute passed. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain'], followed by ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'the Captai['his lieutenant', 'his lieutenant', 'The latter'], entered the drawing-room. ['I', 'I'] had not seen ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain'] for some time. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain'] seemed dull. Without noticing or speaking to us, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain'] went to the panel, looked at the poulps, and said something to ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'the Captai['his lieutenant', 'his lieutenant', 'The latter']. ['his lieutenant', 'his lieutenant', 'The latter'] went out. Soon the panels were shut. The ceiling was lighted. ['I', 'I'] went towards ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'the Captain']. 
 
“A curious collection of poulps?” I said. 
 
“Yes, indeed, Mr. Naturalist,” he replied; “and we are going to fight them, man to beast.” 
 
['I', 'I', 'I'] looked at him. ['I', 'I', 'I'] thought ['I', 'I', 'I'] had not heard aright. 
 
“Man to beast?” I repeated. 
 
“Yes, sir. The screw is stopped. I think that the horny jaws of one of the cuttlefish ['is', 'That'] entangled in the blades. ['is', 'That'] is what prevents our moving.” 
 
“What are you going to do?” 
 
“Rise to the surface, and slaughter this vermin.” 
 
“A difficult enterprise.” 
 
“Yes, indeed. ['The electric bullets', 'they', 'them'] are powerless against the soft flesh, where ['The electric bullets', 'they', 'them'] do not find resistance enough to go off. But we shall attack ['The electric bullets', 'they', 'them'] with the hatchet.” 
 
“And the harpoon, ['sir', 'you'],” said ['the Canadian', 'my'], “if ['sir', 'you'] do not refuse ['the Canadian', 'my'] help.” 
 
“['I', 'Master Land'] will accept it, ['I', 'Master Land'].” 
 
“['We', 'we'] will follow you,” I said, and, following Captain Nemo, ['We', 'we'] went towards the central staircase. 
 
There, ['about ten men with boarding-hatchets', 'the sailors'] were ready for the attack. ['Conseil and I', 'we', 'We'] took two hatchets; Ned Land seized a harpoon. The _Nautilus_ had then risen to the surface. One of ['about ten men with boarding-hatchets', 'the sailors'], posted on the top ladderstep, unscrewed ['the bolts of the panels', 'the screws']. But hardly were ['the bolts of the panels', 'the screws'] loosed, when the panel rose with great violence, evidently drawn by the suckers of a poulp’s arm. Immediately ['one of these arms', 'this formidable tentacle, that slid wriggling down the ladder'] slid like a serpent down the opening and twenty others were above. With one blow of the axe, ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'him'] cut ['one of these arms', 'this formidable tentacle, that slid wriggling down the ladder']. Just as ['Conseil and I', 'we', 'We'] were pressing one on the other to reach the platform, two other arms, lashing the air, came down on ['the seaman placed before Captain N['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'him'], and lifted ['the seaman placed before Captain Nemo', 'him'] up with irresistible power. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'him'] uttered a cry, and rushed out. ['Conseil and I', 'we', 'We'] hurried after ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'him']. 
 
[Illustration] One of these long arms glided through the opening 
 
What a scene! ['The unhappy man', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'The unfortunate man', 'him'], seized by the tentacle and fixed to the suckers, was balanced in the air at the caprice of this enormous trunk. ['The unhappy man', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'The unfortunate man', 'him'] rattled in ['The unhappy man', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'The unfortunate man', 'him'] throat, ['The unhappy man', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'The unfortunate man', 'him'] was stifled, ['The unhappy man', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'The unfortunate man', 'him'] cried, “Help! help!” These words, spoken in French, startled ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I']! ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] had a fellow-countryman on board, perhaps several! ['That heart-rending cry!', 'it'] ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] shall hear ['That heart-rending cry!', 'it'] all ['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] life. ['The unhappy man', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'The unfortunate man', 'him'] was lost. Who could rescue ['The unhappy man', 'He', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'The unfortunate man', 'him'] from that powerful pressure? However, ['Captain Nemo', 'His'] had rushed to the poulp, and with one blow of the axe had cut through one arm. ['Captain Nemo', 'His'] lieutenant struggled furiously against other monsters that crept on the flanks of the _Nautilus_. ['The crew', 'their'] fought with ['The crew', 'their'] axes. ['The Canadian, Conseil, and I', 'our'['me', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] buried ['The Canadian, Conseil, and I', 'our'] weapons in the fleshy masses; a strong smell of musk penetrated the atmosphere. It was horrible! 
 
For one instant, ['I', 'my', 'my'] thought ['the unhappy man', 'the victim', 'my unfortunate countryman'], entangled with ['the poulp', 'its', 'it', 'the animal', 'the cuttlefish', 'it', 'the cuttle fish'], would be torn from ['the poulp', 'its', 'it', 'the animal', 'the cuttlefish', 'it', 'the cuttle fish'] powerful suction. Seven of the eight arms had been cut off. One only wriggled in the air, brandishing ['the unhappy man', 'the victim', 'my unfortunate countryman'] like a feather. But just as ['Captain N['Captain Nemo and his lieutenant',['Captain Nemo', 'his']hemselves'] threw ['Captain Nemo and his lieutenant', 'themselves'] on ['the poulp', 'its', 'it', 'the animal', 'the cuttlefish', 'it', 'the cuttle fish'], ['the poulp', 'its', 'it', 'the animal', 'the cuttlefish', 'it', 'the cuttle fish'] ejected ['a stream of black liquid', 'it']. ['We', 'We'] were blinded with ['a stream of black liquid', 'it']. When the cloud dispersed, ['the poulp', 'its', 'it', 'the animal', 'the cuttlefish', 'it', 'the cuttle fish'] had disappeared, and ['the unhappy man', 'the victim', 'my['I', 'my', 'my']nfortunate countryman'] with ['the poulp', 'its', 'it', 'the animal', 'the cuttlefish', 'it', 'the cuttle fish']. ['Ten or twelve poulps', 'this nest of serpents, that wriggled on the platform in the waves of blood and ink'] now invaded ['the platform', 'the platform'] and sides of the _Nautilus_. ['We', 'We'] rolled pell-mell into the midst of ['Ten or twelve poulps', 'this nest of serpents, that wriggled on th['the platform', 'the platform']n the waves of blood and ink']. It seemed as though these slimy tentacles sprang up like the hydra’s heads. ['Ned Land’s', 'my bold companion', 'he'] harpoon, at each stroke, was plunged into the staring eyes of ['the poulp', 'its', 'it', 'the animal', 'the cuttlefish', 'it', 'the cuttle fish']. But ['I', 'my', 'my['Ned Land’s', 'my bold companion', 'he'] was suddenly overturned by the tentacles of a monster ['Ned Land’s', 'my bold companion', 'he'] had not been able to avoid. 
 
Ah! how ['my', 'I', 'me'] heart beat with emotion and horror! The formidable beak of a cuttlefish was open over ['Ned Land', 'The unhappy man', 'his', 'the poulp']. ['Ned Land', 'The unhappy man', 'his', 'the poulp'] would be cut in two. ['my', 'I', 'me'] rushed to ['Ned Land', 'The unhappy man', 'his', 'the poulp'] succour. But ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'his'] was before ['my', 'I', 'me']; ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'his'] axe disappeared between the two enormous jaws, and, miraculously saved, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'his'], rising, plunged ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'the Canadian', 'his'] harpoon deep into the triple heart of ['Ned Land', 'The unhappy man', 'his', 'the poulp']. 
 
“['I', 'myself', 'the Captain'] owed ['I', 'myself', 'the Captain'] this revenge!” said ['I', 'myself', 'the Captain'] to the Canadian. 
 
Ned bowed without replying. The combat had lasted a quarter of an hour. The monsters, vanquished and mutilated, left us at last, and disappeared under the waves. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his'], covered with blood, nearly exhausted, gazed upon the sea that had swallowed up one of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his'] companions, and great tears gathered in ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'his'] eyes. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XIX THE GULF STREAM 
 
['This terrible scene of the 20th of April', 'it', 'it', 'it'] none of us can ever forget. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'the most illustrious of our poets, the author of The Toilers of the Deep'] have written ['This terrible scene of the 20th of April', 'it', 'it', 'it'] under the influence of violent emotion. Since then ['I', 'I', 'I', 'the most illustrious of our poets, the author of The Toilers of the Deep'] have revised the recital; ['I', 'I', 'I', 'the most illustrious of our poets, the author of The Toilers of the Deep'] have read ['This terrible scene of the 20th of April', 'it', 'it', 'it'] to ['Conseil and to the Canadian', 'They']. ['Conseil and to the Canadian', 'They'] found ['This terrible scene of the 20th of April', 'it', 'it', 'it'] exact as to facts, but insufficient as to effect. To paint such pictures, one must have the pen of ['I', 'I', 'I', 'the most illustrious of our poets, the author of The Toilers of the Deep']. 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] have said that ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'the unfortunate man', 'The poor Frenchman', 'his', 'his', 'the Captain', 'him'] wept while watching the waves; ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'the unfortunate man', 'The poor Frenchman', 'his', 'his', 'the Captain', 'him'] grief was great. It was ['the second companion he had lost since['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'the unfortunate man', 'The poor Frenchman', 'his', 'his', 'the Captain', 'him']ur arrival on board', 'That friend'], and what a death! ['the second companion he had lost since our arrival on board', 'Th['That friend, crushed, stifled, bruised by the dreadful arms of a poulp, pounded by his iron jaws', ['That friend, crushed, stifled, bruised by the dreadful arms of a poulp, pounded by his iron jaws', 'his', 'his']s', 'his'], would not rest with ['That friend, crushed, stifled, bruised by the dreadful arms of a poulp, pounded by his iron jaws', 'his', 'his'] comrades in the peaceful coral cemetery! In the midst of the struggle, it was the despairing cry uttered by ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'the unfortunate man', 'The poor Frenchman', 'his', 'his', 'the Captain', 'him'] that had torn ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] heart. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'the unfortunate man', 'The poor Frenchman', 'his', 'his', 'the Captain', 'him'], forgetting ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'the unfortunate man', 'The poor Frenchman', 'his', 'his', 'the Captain', 'him'] conventional language, had taken to ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'the unfortunate man', 'The poor Frenchman', 'his', 'his', 'the Captain', 'him'] own mother tongue, to utter a last appeal! Amongst the crew of the _Nautilus_, associated with the body and soul of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'the unfortunate man', 'The poor Frenchman', 'his', 'his', 'the Captain', 'him'], recoiling like ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'he', 'the unfortunate man', 'The poor Frenchman', 'his', 'his', 'the Captain', 'him'] from all contact with men, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] had ['a fellow-countryman', 'he alone']. Did ['a fellow-countryman', 'he alone'] represent France in this mysterious association, evidently composed of individuals of divers nationalities? It was one of these insoluble problems that rose up unceasingly before ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my'] mind! 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'his'] entered ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'his'] room, and ['I', 'I', 'I'] saw ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'his'] no more for some time. But that ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'his'] was sad and irresolute ['I', 'I', 'I'] could see by ['the vessel, of which he was the soul, and which received all his impressions', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its',['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'his']it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 't['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'his']_Nautilus_']. ['the vessel, of which he was the soul, and which received all his impressions', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] did not keep on in ['the vessel, of which he was the soul, and which received all his impressions', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] settled course; ['the vessel, of which he was the soul, and which received all his impressions', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] floated about like a corpse at the will of the waves. ['the vessel, of which he was the soul, and which received all his impressions', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] went at random. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'his'] could not tear ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'his'] away from the scene of the last struggle, from this sea that had devoured one of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'he', 'he', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'his'] men. Ten days passed thus. It was not till the 1st of May that ['the vessel, of which he was the soul, and which received all his impressions', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] resumed ['the vessel, of which he was the soul, and which received all his impressions', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] northerly course, after having sighted the Bahamas at the mouth of the Bahama Canal. We were then following ['the current', 'the current'] from ['the largest river', 'its', 'its', 'its'] to the sea, that has ['the largest river', 'its', 'its', 'its'] banks, ['the largest river', 'its', 'its', 'its'] fish, and ['the largest river', 'its', 'its', 'its'] proper temperatures. ['I', 'I', 'I'] mean ['the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'this ocean river']. ['the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'this ocean river'] is really a river, that flows freely to the middle of the Atlantic, and whose waters do not mix with the ocean waters. ['the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'this ocean river'] is a salt river, salter than the surrounding sea. ['the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'this ocean river'] mean depth is 1,500 fathoms, ['the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'this ocean river'] mean breadth ten miles. In certain places ['the current', 'the current'] flows with the speed of two miles and a half an hour. The body of ['the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'this ocean river'] waters is more considerable than that of all the rivers in the globe. It was on ['the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'It', 'Its', 'its', 'its', 'this ocean river'] that ['the vessel, of which he was the soul, and which received all his impressions', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_'] then sailed. 
 
['I', 'I'] must add that, during the night, the phosphorescent waters of ['the Gulf Stream', 'the Gulf Stream', 'its', 'the Gulf Stream'] rivalled the electric power of ['our', 'us', 'we', 'We', 'We'] watch-light, especially in the stormy weather that threatened ['our', 'us', 'we', 'We', 'We'] so frequently. May 8th, ['our', 'us', 'we', 'We', 'We'] were still crossing Cape Hatteras, at the height of the North Caroline. The width of ['the Gulf Stream', 'the Gulf Stream', 'its', 'the Gulf Stream'] there is seventy-five miles, and ['the Gulf Stream', 'the Gulf Stream', 'its', 'the Gulf Stream'] depth 210 yards. ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] still went at random; all supervision seemed abandoned. ['I', 'I'] thought that, under these circumstances, escape would be possible. Indeed, ['the inhabited shores', 'those shores where tempests are so frequent, that country of waterspouts and cyclones actually engendered by the current of the Gulf Stream'] offered anywhere an easy refuge. ['The sea', 'the sea'] was incessantly ploughed by the steamers that ply between New York or Boston and the Gulf of Mexico, and overrun day and night by the little schooners coasting about the several parts of the American coast. ['our', 'us', 'we', 'We', 'We'] could hope to be picked up. It was a favourable opportunity, notwithstanding the thirty miles that separated ['The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_'] from the coasts of the Union. One unfortunate circumstance thwarted the Canadian’s plans. The weather was very bad. ['our', 'us', 'we', 'We', 'We'] were nearing ['the inhabited shores', 'those shores where tempests are so frequent, that country of waterspouts and cyclones actually engendered by the current of th['the Gulf Stream', 'the Gulf Stream', 'its', 'the Gulf Stream']. To tempt ['The sea', 'the sea'] in a frail boat ['was', 'this'] certain destruction. ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'He'] owned ['was', 'this'] ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'He']. ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'He'] fretted, seized with nostalgia that flight only could cure. 
 
“['Master', 'me', 'you'],” ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] said that day to ['Master', 'me', 'you'], “this must come to an end. ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] must make a clean breast of it. ['This Nemo', 'him'] is leaving land and going up to ['the north', 'the North']. But ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] declare to ['Master', 'me', 'you'] that ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] have had enough of the South Pole, and ['he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] will not follow ['This Nemo', 'him'] to ['the north', 'the North'].” 
 
“What is to be done, Ned, since flight is impracticable just now?” 
 
“['We', 'we', 'we'] must speak to ['the Captain', 'you', 'your', 'Sir'],” said ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I']; “['the Captain', 'you', 'your', 'Sir'] said nothing when ['We', 'we', 'we'] were in ['the Captain', 'you', 'your', 'Sir'] native seas. ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] will speak, now ['We', 'we', 'we'] are in ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I']. When ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] think that before long the _Nautilus_ will be by Nova Scotia, and that there near New foundland is ['a large bay', 'that bay'], and into ['a large bay', 'that bay'] ['the St. Lawrence', 'itself', 'the St. Lawrence'] empties ['the St. Lawrence', 'itself', 'the St. Lawrence'], and that ['the St. Lawrence', 'itself', 'the St. Lawrence'] is ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] river, the river by Quebec, ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] native town—when ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] think of ['this', 'it'], ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] feel furious, ['this', 'it'] makes ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] hair stand on end. ['the Captain', 'you', 'your', 'Sir'], ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] would rather throw ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] into the sea! ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] will not stay here! ['he', 'I', 'mine', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] am stifled!” 
 
['The Canadian', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'his'] was evidently losing all patience. ['The Canadian', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'his'] vigorous nature could not stand this prolonged imprisonment. ['The Canadian', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'his'] face altered daily; ['The Canadian', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'his'] temper became more surly. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] knew what ['The Canadian', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'his'] must suffer, for ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] was seized with home-sickness ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'me']. Nearly seven months had passed without our having had any news from land; ['The Canadian', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'his'] isolation, ['The Canadian', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'his'] altered spirits, especially since the fight with the poulps, ['The Canadian', 'His', 'His', 'his', 'he', 'Captain Nemo’s', 'his', 'his'] taciturnity, all made ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'me'] view things in a different light. 
 
“Well, sir?” said ['Ned', 'I'], seeing ['Ned', 'I'] did not reply. 
 
“Well, ['Ned', 'you'], do ['Ned', 'you'] wish me to ask ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] intentions concerning us?” 
 
“Yes, sir.” 
 
“Although he has already made them known?” 
 
“Yes; ['I', 'me', 'my'] wish it settled finally. Speak for ['I', 'me', 'my'], in ['I', 'me', 'my'] name only, if you like.” 
 
“But ['I', 'me'] so seldom meet ['him', 'He']. ['him', 'He'] avoids ['I', 'me'].” 
 
“That is all the more reason for you to go to see him.” 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'You', 'you'] went to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'You', 'you'] room. From thence ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'You', 'you'] meant to go to ['Captain Nemo’s', 'him', 'The Captain', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his']. It would not do to let this opportunity of meeting ['Captain Nemo’s', 'him', 'The Captain', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his'] slip. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'You', 'you'] knocked at ['the door', 'The door']. No answer. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'You', 'you'] knocked again, then turned the handle. ['the door', 'The door'] opened, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'You', 'you'] went in. ['Captain Nemo’s', 'him', 'The Captain', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his'] was there. Bending over ['Captain Nemo’s', 'him', 'The Captain', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his'] work-table, ['Captain Nemo’s', 'him', 'The Captain', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his'] had not heard ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'You', 'you']. Resolved not to go without having spoken, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'You', 'you'] approached ['Captain Nemo’s', 'him', 'The Captain', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his']. ['Captain Nemo’s', 'him', 'The Captain', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his'] raised ['Captain Nemo’s', 'him', 'The Captain', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his'] head quickly, frowned, and said roughly, “['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'You', 'you'] here! What do ['I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'You', 'you'] want?” 
 
“To speak to ['you', 'Captain'], ['you', 'Captain'].” 
 
“But ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am busy, ['sir', 'you', 'yourself']; ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am working. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] leave ['sir', 'you', 'yourself'] at liberty to shut ['sir', 'you', 'yourself'] up; cannot ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] be allowed the same?” 
 
This reception was not encouraging; but I was determined to hear and answer everything. 
 
“['Sir', 'you'],” ['I', 'I'] said coldly, “['I', 'I'] have to speak to ['Sir', 'you'] on a matter that admits of no delay.” 
 
“What is that, ['sir', 'he', 'you', 'me']?” ['sir', 'he', 'you', 'me'] replied, ironically. “Have ['sir', 'he', 'you', 'me'] discovered something that has escaped ['sir', 'he', 'you', 'me'], or has the sea delivered up any new secrets?” 
 
We were at cross-purposes. But, before ['I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my'] could reply, ['he', 'his'] showed ['I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my'] ['an open manuscript on his table', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'This manuscript, signed with my name, complete with the history of ['he', 'his']life'], and said, in a more serious tone, “Here, M. Aronnax, is a manuscript written in several languages. ['an open manuscript on his table', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'This manuscript, signed with my name, complete with the history of my life'] contains the sum of ['I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my'] studies of ['the sea', 'the sea']; and, if ['an open manuscript on his table', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'This manuscript, signed with my name, complete with the history of my life'] please God, ['an open manuscript on his table', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'This manuscript, signed with my name, complete with the history of my life'] shall not perish with ['I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my']. ['an open manuscript on his table', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'This manuscript, signed with my['I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my']ame, complete with the history of my['I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'my', 'my']ife'], will be shut up in ['a little floating case', 'this case', 'it', 'it']. The last survivor of all of us on board the _Nautilus_ will throw ['a little floating case', 'this case', 'it', 'it'] into ['the sea', 'the sea'], and ['a little floating case', 'this case', 'it', 'it'] will go whither ['a little floating case', 'this case', 'it', 'it'] is borne by the waves.” 
 
['This man’s', 'his', 'himself', 'His'] name! ['This man’s', 'his', 'himself', 'His'] history written by ['This man’s', 'his', 'himself', 'His']! ['This man’s', 'his', 'himself', 'His'] mystery would then be revealed some day. 
 
“['Captain', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'yours'],” ['I', 'I', 'me'] said, “['I', 'I', 'me'] can but approve of the idea that makes ['Captain', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'yours'] act thus. The result of ['Captain', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'yours'] studies must not be lost. But the means ['Captain', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'yours'] employ seem to ['I', 'I', 'me'] to be primitive. Who knows where the winds will carry ['this case', 'it'], and in whose hands ['this case', 'it'] will fall? Could ['Captain', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'yours'] not use some other means? Could not ['Captain', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'yours'], or one of ['Captain', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'yours']——” 
 
“Never, ['sir', 'me']!” he said, hastily interrupting ['sir', 'me']. 
 
“But ['I', 'my'['I and my compa['I', 'my']ons', 'us'] are ready to keep this manuscript in store; and, if you will put ['I and my companions', 'us'] at liberty——” 
 
“At liberty?” said the Captain, rising. 
 
“Yes, ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'your']; that is the subject on which ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] wish to question ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'your']. For seven months ['we', 'us'] have been here on board, and ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] ask ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'your'] to-day, in the name of ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] companions and in ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] own, if ['sir', 'you', 'you', 'your'] intention is to keep ['we', 'us'] here always?” 
 
“['M. Aronnax', 'you'], ['I', 'I'] will answer ['M. Aronnax', 'you'] to-day as ['I', 'I'] did seven months ago: Whoever enters ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'], must never quit ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'].” 
 
“You impose actual slavery upon us!” 
 
“Give it what name you please.” 
 
“But everywhere ['the slave', 'his'] has the right to regain ['the slave', 'his'] liberty.” 
 
“Who denies ['you', 'I', 'you'] this right? Have ['you', 'I', 'you'] ever tried to chain ['you', 'I', 'you'] with an oath?” 
 
['He', 'his'] looked at me with ['He', 'his'] arms crossed. 
 
“['Sir', 'your', 'you', 'you'],” ['I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] said, “to return a second time to ['this subject', 'it', 'it', 'it'] will be neither to ['Sir', 'your', 'you', 'you'] nor to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] taste; but, as ['we', 'us'] have entered upon ['this subject', 'it', 'it', 'it'], let ['we', 'us'] go through with ['this subject', 'it', 'it', 'it']. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] repeat, it is not only ['I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] whom ['this subject', 'it', 'it', 'it'] concerns. Study is to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] a relief, a diversion, a passion that could make ['I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] forget everything. Like ['Sir', 'your', 'you', 'you'], ['I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] am willing to live obscure, in the frail hope of bequeathing one day, to future time, the result of ['I', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'me', 'me', 'I', 'my'] labours. But it is otherwise with Ned Land. Every man, worthy of the name, deserves some consideration. Have ['Sir', 'your', 'you', 'you'] thought that love of liberty, hatred of slavery, can give rise to schemes of revenge in a nature like ['the Canadian’s', 'he']; that ['the Canadian’s', 'he'] could think, attempt, and try——” 
 
I was silenced; Captain Nemo rose. 
 
“Whatever ['Ned Land', 'him', 'him'] thinks of, attempts, or tries, what does it matter to ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I']? ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] did not seek ['Ned Land', 'him', 'him']! It is not for ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] pleasure that ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] keep ['Ned Land', 'him', 'him'] on board! As for ['you', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'], ['you', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'], ['you', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] are one of those who can understand everything, even silence. ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] have nothing more to say to ['you', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you']. Let this first time ['you', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'] have come to treat of this subject be the last, for a second time ['me', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I'] will not listen to ['you', 'M. Aronnax', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you'].” 
 
['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] retired. Our situation was critical. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] related ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] conversation to ['I', 'I', 'my', 'my'] two companions. 
 
“['We', 'we', 'We'] know now,” said Ned, “that ['We', 'we', 'We'] can expect nothing from ['this man', 'The _Nautilus_']. ['this man', 'The _Nautilus_'] is nearing Long Island. ['We', 'we', 'We'] will escape, whatever the weather may be.” 
 
But the sky became more and more threatening. Symptoms of a hurricane became manifest. ['The atmosphere', 'the atmosphere'] was becoming white and misty. On the horizon fine streaks of cirrhous clouds were succeeded by masses of cumuli. Other low clouds passed swiftly by. ['The swollen sea', 'the sea', 'it', 'The raging sea', 'the sea'] rose in huge billows. The birds disappeared with the exception of the petrels, those friends of the storm. The barometer fell sensibly, and indicated an extreme extension of the vapours. The mixture of the storm glass was decomposed under the influence of the electricity that pervaded ['The atmosphere', 'the atmosphere']. ['The tempest', 'the tempest', 'it', 'the tempest', 'the tempest', 'the tempest'] burst on the 18th of May, just as ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] was floating off Long Island, some miles from the port of ['New York', 'New York']. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] can describe this strife of the elements! for, instead of fleeing to the depths of ['The swollen sea', 'the sea', 'it', 'The raging sea', 'the sea'], ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'this extraordinary man who was coping with it', 'the captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo'], by an unaccountable caprice, would brave ['The swollen sea', 'the sea', 'it', 'The raging sea', 'the sea'] at the surface. The wind blew from the south-west at first. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'this extraordinary man who was coping with it', 'the captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo'], during the squalls, had taken ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'this extraordinary man who was coping with it', 'the captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo'] place on the platform. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'this extraordinary man who was coping with it', 'the captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo'] had made ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'this extraordinary man who was coping with it', 'the captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo'] fast, to prevent being washed overboard by ['the monstrous waves', 'the waves', 'these raging waves', 'They', 'their', 'Their', 'these']. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] had hoisted ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] up, and made ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] fast also, dividing ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] admiration between ['The tempest', 'the tempest', 'it', 'the tempest', 'the tempest', 'the tempest'] and ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'this extraordinary man who was coping with it', 'the captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo['The tempest', 'the tempest', 'it', 'the tempest', 'the tempest', 'the tempest']. ['The swollen sea', 'the sea', 'it', 'The raging sea', 'the sea'] was swept by huge cloud-drifts, which were actually saturated with ['the monstrous waves', 'the waves', 'these raging waves', 'They', 'their', 'Their', 'these']. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'], sometimes lying on ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] side, sometimes standing up like a mast, rolled and pitched terribly. About five o’clock a torrent of rain fell, that lulled neither sea nor wind. ['The hurri cane', 'it'] blew nearly forty leagues an hour. It is under these conditions that ['The hurri cane', 'it'] overturns houses, breaks iron gates, displaces twenty-four pounders. However, ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'], in the midst of ['The tempest', 'the tempest', 'it', 'the tempest', 'the tempest', 'the tempest'], confirmed the words of a clever engineer, “There is no well-constructed hull that cannot defy ['The swollen sea', 'the sea', 'it', 'The raging sea', 'the sea'].” ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] was not a resisting rock; ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] was a steel spindle, obedient and movable, without rigging or masts, that braved ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] fury with impunity. However, ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] watched ['the monstrous waves', 'the waves', 'these raging waves', 'They', 'their', 'Their', 'these'] attentively. ['the monstrous waves', 'the waves', 'these raging waves', 'They', 'their', 'Their', 'these'] measured fifteen feet in height, and 150 to 175 yards long, and ['the monstrous waves', 'the waves', 'these raging waves', 'They', 'their', 'Their', 'these'] speed of propagation was thirty feet per second. ['the monstrous waves', 'the waves', 'these raging waves', 'They', 'their', 'Their', 'these'] bulk and power increased with the depth of the water. ['Such waves as these', 'T['the monstrous waves', 'the waves', 'these raging waves', 'They', 'their', 'Their', 'these'], at the Hebrides, have displaced a mass weighing 8,400 lbs. ['Such waves as these', 'They'] are they which, in the tempest of ['December 23rd, 1864', 'the same day'], after destroying the town of Yeddo, in Japan, broke ['December 23rd, 1864', 'the same day'] on the shores of America. The intensity of ['The tempest', 'the tempest', 'it', 'the tempest', 'the tempest', 'the tempest'] increased with the night. The barometer, as in 1860 at Reunion during a cyclone, fell seven-tenths at the close of day. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] saw ['a large vessel', 'She', 'It', 'It'] pass the horizon struggling painfully. ['a large vessel', 'She', 'It', 'It'] was trying to lie to under half steam, to keep up above the waves. ['a large vessel', 'She', 'It', 'It'] was probably one of the steamers of the line from ['New York', 'New York'] to Liverpool, or Havre. ['a large vessel', 'She', 'It', 'It'] soon disappeared in the gloom. At ten o’clock in the evening the sky was on fire. The atmosphere was streaked with ['vivid lightning', 'it', 'it']. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] could not bear the brightness of ['vivid lightning', 'it', 'it']; while ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'this extraordinary man who was coping with it', 'the captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo'], looking at ['vivid lightning', 'it', 'it'], seemed to envy the spirit of ['The tempest', 'the tempest', 'it', 'the tempest', 'the tempest', 'the tempest']. A terrible noise filled the air, a complex noise, made up of the howls of the crushed waves, the roaring of ['the wind', 'The wind'], and the claps of thunder. ['the wind', 'The wind'] veered suddenly to all points of the horizon; and the cyclone, rising in the east, returned after passing by the north, west, and south, in the inverse course pursued by ['the circular storm of the southern hemisphere', 'The storm', 'its']. Ah, ['that Gulf Stream', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'its']! ['that Gulf Stream', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'its'] deserves ['that Gulf Stream', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'its'] name of the King of Tempests. It is that which causes those formidable cyclones, by the difference of temperature between ['that Gulf Stream', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'its'] air and ['that Gulf Stream', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'its'] currents. A shower of fire had succeeded the rain. The drops of water were changed to sharp spikes. One would have thought that ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'this extraordinary man who was coping with it', 'the captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo'] was courting a death worthy of ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'this extraordinary man who was coping with it', 'the captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo'], a death by lightning. As ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'], pitching dreadfully, raised ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] steel spur in the air, ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] seemed to act as a conductor, and ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] saw long sparks burst from ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_']. Crushed and without strength ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] crawled to ['the panel', 'it'], opened ['the panel', 'it'], and descended to ['the saloon', 'the saloon']. ['the circular storm of the southern hemisphere', 'The storm', 'its'] was then at ['the circular storm of the southern hemisphere', 'The storm', 'its'] height. It was impossible to stand upright in the interior of ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_']. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'himself', 'this extraordinary man who was coping with it', 'the captain', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'Captain Nemo'] came down about twelve. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] heard the reservoirs filling by degrees, and ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] sank slowly beneath the waves. Through the open windows in ['the saloon', 'the saloon'] ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] saw large fish terrified, passing like phantoms in the water. Some were struck before ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] eyes. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'This', 'it', 'its', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] was still descending. ['I', 'I', 'myself', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] thought that at about eight fathoms deep ['we', 'We'] should ['find', 'that'] a calm. But no! the upper beds were too violently agitated for ['find', 'that']. ['we', 'We'] had to seek repose at more than twenty-five fathoms in the bowels of the deep. But there, what quiet, what silence, what peace! Who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on the surface of that ocean? 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XX FROM LATITUDE 47° 24′ TO LONGITUDE 17° 28′ 
 
In consequence of the storm, ['we', 'Conseil and I', 'our'] had been thrown eastward once more. All hope of escape on the shores of New York or St. Lawrence had faded away; and ['poor Ned', 'himself'], in despair, had isolated ['poor Ned', 'himself'] like Captain Nemo. ['we', 'Conseil and I', 'our'['I', 'I', 'I'], however, never left each other. ['I', 'I', 'I'] said that ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] had gone aside to the east. ['I', 'I', 'I'] should have said (to be more exact) the north-east. For some days, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it'] wandered first on ['the surface', 'it'], and then beneath ['the surface', 'it'], amid ['those fogs so dreaded by sailors', 'these thick fogs']. What accidents are due to ['those fogs so dreaded by sailors', 'these thick fogs']! What shocks upon these reefs when the wind drowns the breaking of the waves! What collisions between ['vessels', 'their'], in spite of ['vessels', 'their'] warning lights, whistles, and alarm bells! And the bottoms of these seas look like a field of battle, where still lie all the conquered of the ocean; some old and already encrusted, ['others', 'their'] fresh and reflecting from ['others', 'their'] iron bands and copper plates the brilliancy of ['we', 'Conseil and I', 'our'] lantern. 
 
On the 15th of May we were at the extreme south of ['the Bank of Newfoundland', ['Newfoundland', 'Newfoundland']. ['the Bank of Newfoundland', 'This bank'] consists of alluvia, or large heaps of organic matter, brought either from the Equator by ['the Gulf Stream', 'the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it'], or from the North Pole by the counter-current of cold water which skirts the American coast. There also are heaped up those erratic blocks which are carried along by the broken ice; and close by, a vast charnel-house of molluscs, which perish here by millions. The depth of the sea is not great at ['Newfoundland', 'Newfoundland']—not more than some hundreds of fathoms; but towards the south is a depression of 1,500 fathoms. There ['the Gulf Stream', 'the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it'] widens. ['the Gulf Stream', 'the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it'] loses some of ['the Gulf Stream', 'the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it'] speed and some of ['the Gulf Stream', 'the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it'] temperature, but ['the Gulf Stream', 'the Gulf Stream', 'It', 'its', 'its', 'it'] becomes a sea. 
 
It was on the 17th of May, about 500 miles from Heart’s Content, at a depth of more than 1,400 fathoms, that ['I', 'I', 'I'] saw ['the electric cable', 'it', 'it', 'this cable'] lying on the bottom. ['Conseil, to whom I had not mentioned it'['I', 'I', 'I'] 'the worthy fellow['the electric cable', 'it', 'it', 'this cable'], thought at first that ['the electric cable', 'it', 'it', 'this cable'] was a gigantic sea-serpent. But ['I', 'I', 'I'] undeceived ['Conseil, to whom I had not mentioned it', 'the worthy fellow'], and by way of consolation related several particulars in the laying of ['the electric cable', 'it', 'it', 'this cable']. The first one was laid in the years 1857 and 1858; but, after transmitting about 400 telegrams, would not act any longer. In 1863 the engineers constructed ['an other one, measuring 2,000 miles in length, and weighing 4,500 tons, which was embarked on the Great Eastern', 'This attempt']. ['an other one, measuring 2,000 miles in length, and weighing 4,500 tons, which was embarked on the Great Eastern', 'This attempt'] also failed. 
 
On the 25th of May ['the _Nautilus_', 'The Great Eastern'], being at a depth of more than 1,918 fathoms, was on ['the precise spot where the rupture occurred which ruined the ente['the enterprise', 'the enterprise']. ['the precise spot where the rupture occurred which ruined the enterprise', 'It'] was within 638 miles of the coast of Ireland; and at half-past two in the afternoon they discovered that communication with Europe had ceased. ['The electricians on board', 'they', 'They', 't['board', 'board'] resolved to cut ['the cable', 'it', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'] before fishing ['the cable', 'it', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'] up, and at eleven o’clock at night ['The electricians on board', 'they', 'They', 'they'] had recovered ['the damaged part', 'it', 'it', 'it']. ['The electricians on board', 'they', 'They', 'they'] made another point and spliced ['the damaged part', 'it', 'it', 'it'], and ['the damaged part', 'it', 'it', 'it'] was once more submerged. But some days after ['the damaged part', 'it', 'it', 'it'] broke again, and in the depths of the ocean could not be recaptured. The Americans, however, were not discouraged. ['Cyrus Field, the bold promoter of the enterprise'['the enterprise', 'the enterprise'], as ['Cyrus Field, the bold promoter of the enterprise', 'he', 'his'] had sunk all ['Cyrus Field, the bold promoter of the enterprise', 'he', 'his'] own fortune, set a new subscription on foot, which was at once answered, and another cable was constructed on better principles. The bundles of conducting wires were each enveloped in gutta-percha, and protected by a wadding of hemp, contained in a metallic covering. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The Great Eastern'] sailed on the 13th of July, 1866. The operation worked well. But one incident occurred. Several times in unrolling ['the cable', 'it', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'] ['The electricians on board', 'they', 'They', 'they'] observed that nails had recently been forced into ['the cable', 'it', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'], evidently with the motive of destroying ['the cable', 'it', 'the cable', 'it', 'it']. Captain Anderson, the officers, and engineers consulted together, and had it posted up that, if ['the offender', 'he'] was surprised on ['board', 'board'], ['the offender', 'he'] would be thrown without further trial into the sea. From that time the criminal attempt was never repeated. 
 
On the 23rd of July the Great Eastern was not more than 500 miles from Newfoundland, when ['they', 'they'] telegraphed from Ireland the news of the armistice concluded between Prussia and Austria after Sadowa. On the 27th, in the midst of heavy fogs, ['they', 'they'] reached the port of Heart’s Content. The enterprise was successfully terminated; and for ['its', 'young America'] first despatch, ['its', 'young America'] addressed old Europe in these words of wisdom, so rarely understood: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill towards men.” 
 
I did not expect to find ['the electric cable', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'this cable', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'] in ['the electric cable', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'this cable', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'] primitive state, such as ['the electric cable', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'this cable', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'] was on leaving the manufactory. The long serpent, covered with the remains of shells, bristling with foraminiferae, was encrusted with a strong coating which served as a protection against all boring molluscs. ['the electric cable', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'this cable', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'] lay quietly sheltered from the motions of ['the sea', 'the ocean'], and under a favourable pressure for the transmission of the electric spark which passes from Europe to America in .32 of a second. Doubtless ['the electric cable', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'this cable', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'] will last for a great length of time, for they find that the gutta-percha covering is improved by the sea-water. Besides, on this level, so well chosen, ['the electric cable', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'this cable', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'] is never so deeply submerged as to cause ['the electric cable', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'this cable', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'] to break. ['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] followed ['the electric cable', 'its', 'it', 'It', 'this cable', 'the cable', 'it', 'it'] to the lowest depth, which was more than 2,212 fathoms, and there ['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] lay without any anchorage; and then ['we', 'We'] reached the spot where the accident had taken place in 1863. The bottom of ['the sea', 'the ocean'] then formed ['a valley about 100 miles broad, in which Mont Blanc might ['Mont Blanc', 'its']placed without its summit appear['Mont Blanc', 'its'] above the waves', 'This valley']. ['a valley about 100 miles broad, in which Mont Blanc might have been placed without its summit appearing above the waves', 'This valley'] is closed at the east by a perpendicular wall more than 2,000 yards high. ['we', 'We'] arrived there on the 28th of May, and ['The _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'] was then not more than 120 miles from Ireland. 
 
Was ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he'] going to land on the British Isles? No. To ['my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] great surprise ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he'] made for the south, once more coming back towards European seas. In rounding the Emerald Isle, for one instant ['my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] caught sight of Cape Clear, and the light which guides the thousands of vessels leaving Glasgow or Liverpool. An important question then arose in ['my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] mind. Did ['the _Nautilus_', 'itself'] dare entangle ['the _Nautilus_', 'itself'] in the Manche? Ned Land, who had re-appeared since we had been nearing land, did not cease to question ['my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me']. How could ['my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] answer? ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he'] remained invisible. After having shown the Canadian a glimpse of American shores, was ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'he'] going to show ['my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'me'] the coast of France? 
 
But ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'he', 'He'] was still going southward. On the 30th of May, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'he', 'He'] passed in sight of Land’s End, between the extreme point of England and the Scilly Isles, which were left to starboard. If we wished to enter the Manche, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'he', 'He'] must go straight to the east. ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'he', 'He'] did not do so. 
 
During the whole of the 31st of May, ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'it', 'the ship’s'] described a series of circles on the water, which greatly interested ['me', 'me', 'my', 'I']. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'it', 'the ship’s'] seemed to be seeking a spot ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'it', 'the ship’s'] had some trouble in finding. At noon, ['Captain Nemo himself', 'himself', 'He', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the capt['Captain Nemo himself', 'himself', 'He', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the captain’s'] came to work ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'it', 'the ship’s'] log. ['Captain Nemo himself', 'himself', 'He', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the captain’s'] spoke no word to ['me', 'me', 'my', 'I'], but seemed gloomier than ever. What could sadden ['Captain Nemo himself', 'himself', 'He', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the captain’s'] thus? Was it ['Captain Nemo himself', 'himself', 'He', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the captain’s'] proxim ity to European shores? Had ['Captain Nemo himself', 'himself', 'He', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the captain’s'] some recollections of ['Captain Nemo himself', 'himself', 'He', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the captain’s'] abandoned country? If not, what did ['Captain Nemo himself', 'himself', 'He', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the captain’s'] feel? Remorse or regret? For a long while this thought haunted ['me', 'me', 'my', 'I'] mind, and ['me', 'me', 'my', 'I'] had a kind of presentiment that before long chance would betray ['Captain Nemo himself', 'himself', 'He', 'him', 'his', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'the captain’s'] secrets. 
 
The next day, the 1st of June, ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'The _Nautilus_', 'it'] continued the same process. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'The _Nautilus_', 'it'] was evidently seeking some particular spot in ['the ocean', 'The sea']. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] took ['the sun’s', 'the sun'] altitude as ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] had done the day before. ['the ocean', 'The sea'] was beautiful, the sky clear. About eight miles to the east, ['a large steam vessel', 'its', 'its'] could be discerned on the horizon. No flag fluttered from ['a large steam vessel', 'its', 'its'] mast, and I could not discover ['a large steam vessel', 'its', 'its'] nationality. Some minutes before ['the sun’s', 'the sun'] passed the meridian, ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] took ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] sextant, and watched with great attention. The perfect rest of the water greatly helped the operation. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'The _Nautilus_', 'it'] was motionless; ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'The _Nautilus_', 'it'] neither rolled nor pitched. 
 
I was on the platform when the altitude was taken, and the Captain pronounced these words: “It is here.” 
 
['He', 'he'] turned and went below. Had ['He', 'he'] seen ['the vessel which was changing its course and seemed to be nearing us', 'its'['the vessel which was changing its course and seemed to be nearing us', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it']The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it['us', 'our', 'us']? ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] could not tell. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] returned to the saloon. ['The panels', 'the panels'] closed, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] heard the hissing of the water in the reservoirs. ['the vessel which was changing its course and seemed to be nearing us', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it'] began to sink, following a vertical line, for ['the vessel which was changing its course and seemed to be nearing us', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it'] screw communicated no motion to ['the vessel which was changing its course and seemed to be nearing us', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it']. Some minutes later ['the vessel which was changing its course and seemed to be nearing us', 'its', 'The _Nautilus_', 'its', 'it', 'it'] stopped at a depth of more than 420 fathoms, resting on the ground. The luminous ceiling was darkened, then ['The panels', 'the panels'] were opened, and through the glass ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw the sea brilliantly illuminated by the rays of ['us', 'our', 'us'] lantern for at least half a mile round ['us', 'our', 'us']. 
 
['I', 'my', 'I'] looked to the port side, and saw nothing but an immensity of quiet waters. But to starboard, on ['the bottom', 'the bottom of the ocean'] appeared ['a large protuberance, which at once attracted my attention', 'it', 'the mass', 'It', '['I', 'my', 'I']is wreck']. One would have thought ['a large protuberance, which at once attracted my attention', 'it', 'the mass', 'It', 'This wreck'] a ruin buried under a coating of white shells, much resembling a covering of snow. Upon examining ['a large protuberance, which at once attracted my attention', 'it', 'the mass', 'It', 'This wreck'] attentively, ['I', 'my', 'I'] could recognise the ever-thickening form of ['a vessel bare of its masts['a vessel bare of its masts, which must have sunk', 'its']hich must have sunk', 'its']. ['a large protuberance, which at once attracted my attention', 'it', 'the mass', 'It', 'This wreck'] certainly belonged to past times. ['a large protuberance, which at once attracted my attention', 'it', 'the mass', 'It', 'This wreck'], to be thus encrusted with the lime of the water, must already be able to count many years passed at ['the bottom', 'the bottom of the ocean']. 
 
What was ['this vessel', 'its', 'it']? Why did the _Nautilus_ visit ['this vessel', 'its', 'it'] tomb? Could it have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn ['this vessel', 'its', 'it'] under the water? ['I', 'me', 'I'] knew not what to think, when near ['I', 'me', 'I'] in a slow voice ['I', 'me', 'I'] heard Captain Nemo say: 
 
“At one time ['this ship', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] was called the Marseillais. ['this ship', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] carried seventy-four guns, and was launched in 1762. In 1778, the 13th of August, commanded by La Poype-Ver trieux, ['this ship', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] fought boldly against the Preston. In 1779, on the 4th of July, ['this ship', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] was at the taking of Grenada, with the squadron of Admiral Estaing. In 1781, on the 5th of September, ['this ship', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] took part in the battle of Comte de Grasse, in Chesapeake Bay. In ['1794', 'the same year'], ['the French Republic', 'its', 'the Republic'] changed ['the French Republic', 'its', 'the Republic'] name. On the 16th of April, in ['1794', 'the same year'], ['this ship', 'It', 'it', 'it', 'it', 'it'] joined the squadron of Villaret Joyeuse, at Brest, being entrusted with the escort of a cargo of corn coming from America, under the command of Admiral Van Stebel. On the 11th and 12th Prairal of the second year, this squadron fell in with an English vessel. Sir, to-day is the 13th Prairal, the first of June, 1868. It is now seventy-four years ago, day for day on this very spot, in latitude 47° 24′, longitude 17° 28′, that ['this vessel', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'], after fighting heroically, losing ['this vessel', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] three masts, with the water in ['this vessel', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] hold, and the third of ['this vessel', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] crew disabled, preferred sinking with ['this vessel', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] 356 sailors to surrendering; and, nailing ['this vessel', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its', 'its'] colours to the poop, disappeared under the waves to the cry of ‘Long live ['the French Republic', 'its', 'the Republic']!’” 
 
“The Avenger!” I exclaimed. 
 
“Yes, sir, the Avenger! A good name!” muttered ['Captain Nemo', 'his'], crossing ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] arms. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXI A HECATOMB 
 
The way of describing this unlooked-for scene, the history of ['the patriot ship', 'the Avenger', 'the glorious wreck', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the Avenger'], told at first so coldly, and the emotion with which this strange man pronounced the last words, the name of ['the patriot ship', 'the Avenger', 'the glorious wreck', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the Avenger'], the significance of which could not escape ['me', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'], all impressed itself deeply on ['me', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] mind. ['me', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] eyes did not leave ['the Captain, who, with his hand stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing ['the Captain, who, with his hand stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious wreck', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'the man', 'the Captain', 'He'] the glorious wreck', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'the man', 't['the patriot ship', 'the Avenger', 'the glorious wreck', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the Avenger']. Perhaps ['me', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] was never to know who ['the Captain, who, with his hand stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious wreck', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'the man', 'the Captain', 'He'] was, from whence ['the Captain, who, with his hand stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious wreck', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'the man', 'the Captain', 'He'] came, or where ['the Captain, who, with his hand stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious wreck', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'the man', 'the Captain', 'He'] was going to, but ['me', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] saw ['the Captain, who, with his hand stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious wreck', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'the man', 'the Captain', 'He'] move, and apart from the _savant_. It was no common misanthropy which had shut ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] and ['Captain Nemo', 'his'] companions within ['the patriot ship', 'the Avenger', 'the glorious wreck', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the Avenger'], but ['a hatred, either monstrous or sublime, which time could never weaken', 'this hatred']. Did ['a hatred, either monstrous or sublime, which time could never weaken', 'this hatred'] still ['seek', 'that'] for vengeance? The future would soon teach ['me', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] ['seek', 'that']. But ['the patriot ship', 'the Avenger', 'the glorious wreck', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the Avenger'] was rising slowly to the surface of the sea, and the form of ['the patriot ship', 'the Avenger', 'the glorious wreck', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the Avenger'] disappeared by degrees from ['me', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] sight. Soon a slight rolling told ['me', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] that we were in the open air. At that moment a dull boom was heard. ['me', 'my', 'My', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'my', 'me', 'I'] looked at ['the Captain, who, with his hand stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious wreck', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'the man', 'the Captain', 'He']. ['the Captain, who, with his hand stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious wreck', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'the man', 'the Captain', 'He'] did not move. 
 
“Captain?” said I. 
 
['He', 'him'] did not answer. I left ['He', 'him'] and mounted the platform. Conseil and the Canadian were already there. 
 
“Where did that sound come from?” I asked. 
 
“It was a gunshot,” replied Ned Land. 
 
['I', 'I'] looked in the direction of ['the vessel I had already seen', 'It', 'the _Nauti['I', 'I']us_', 'it', 'It']. ['the vessel I had already seen', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'It'] was nearing ['the vessel I had already seen', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'It'], and ['we', 'us'] could see that ['the vessel I had already seen', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'It'] was putting on steam. ['the vessel I had already seen', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'It'] was within six miles of ['we', 'us']. 
 
“What is that ship, Ned?” 
 
“By ['its', 'its', 'she', 'it', 'this cursed _Nautilus_'] rigging, and the height of ['its', 'its', 'she', 'it', 'this cursed _Nautilus_'] lower masts,” said ['the Canadian', 'I'], “['the Canadian', 'I'] bet ['its', 'its', 'she', 'it', 'this cursed _Nautilus_'] is a ship-of-war. May ['its', 'its', 'she', 'it', 'this cursed _Nautilus_'] reach us; and, if necessary, sink ['its', 'its', 'she', 'it', 'this cursed _Nautilus_'].” 
 
“Friend Ned,” replied Conseil, “what harm can ['it', 'it', 'its'] do to ['the _Nautilus', 'it']?_ Can ['it', 'it', 'its'] attack ['the _Nautilus', 'it'] beneath the waves? Can ['it', 'it', 'its'] cannonade us at the bottom of the sea?” 
 
“Tell ['me', 'I'], ['Ned', 'you'],” said ['me', 'I'], “can ['Ned', 'you'] recognise what country she belongs to?” 
 
['The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his'] knitted ['The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his'] eyebrows, dropped ['The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his'] eyelids, and screwed up the corners of ['The Canadian', 'his', 'his', 'his'] eyes, and for a few moments fixed a piercing look upon the vessel. 
 
“No, ['sir', 'he', 'I', 'I'],” ['sir', 'he', 'I', 'I'] replied; “['sir', 'he', 'I', 'I'] cannot tell what nation ['she', 'she', 'she', 'her'] belongs to, for ['she', 'she', 'she', 'her'] shows no colours. But ['sir', 'he', 'I', 'I'] can declare ['she', 'she', 'she', 'her'] is a man-of-war, for a long pennant flutters from ['she', 'she', 'she', 'her'] main mast.” 
 
For a quarter of an hour ['we', 'us', 'us', 'us'] watched ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her['we', 'us', 'us', 'us']. ['I', 'me'] could not, however, believe that ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] could see ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] from ['that distance', 'The distance']; and still less that ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] could know what this submarine engine was. Soon the Canadian informed ['I', 'me'] that ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] was a large, armoured, two-decker ram. A thick black smoke was pouring from ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] two funnels. ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] closely-furled sails were stopped to ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] yards. ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] hoisted no flag at ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] mizzen-peak. ['that distance', 'The distance'] prevented ['we', 'us', 'us', 'us'] from distinguishing the colours of ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] pennant, which floated like a thin ribbon. ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] advanced rapidly. If Captain Nemo allowed ['the ship which was steaming towards us', 'she', 'the _Nautilus_', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'Her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her'] to approach, there was a chance of salvation for ['we', 'us', 'us', 'us']. 
 
“['Sir', 'you'],” said ['Ned Land', 'I', 'myself', 'I'], “if that vessel passes within a mile of us ['Ned Land', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] shall throw ['Ned Land', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] into the sea, and ['Ned Land', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] should advise ['Sir', 'you'] to do the same.” 
 
['I', 'my'] did not reply to the Canadian’s suggestion, but continued watching ['the ship', 'she', 'her', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus_']. Whether English, French, American, or Russian, ['the ship', 'she', 'her', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'] would be sure to take ['us', 'we'] in if ['us', 'we'] could only reach ['the ship', 'she', 'her', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus_']. Presently a white smoke burst from the fore part of ['the ship', 'she', 'her', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus_']; some seconds after, the water, agitated by the fall of a heavy body, splashed the stern of ['the ship', 'she', 'her', 'the vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'], and shortly afterwards a loud explosion struck ['I', 'my'] ear. 
 
“What! they are firing at us!” I exclaimed. 
 
“So please ['you', 'sir', 'Ned'], ['you', 'sir', 'Ned'],” said ['you', 'sir', 'Ned'], “['they', 'they'] have recognised the unicorn, and ['they', 'they'] are firing at us.” 
 
“But,” I exclaimed, “surely they can see that there are men in the case?” 
 
“It is, perhaps, because of that,” replied Ned Land, looking at me. 
 
A whole flood of light burst upon ['my', 'I', 'me', 'Sir'] mind. Doubtless they knew now how to believe the stories of the pretended monster. No doubt, on board ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus', 'the approaching ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'], when ['the Canadian', 'The Canadian'] struck ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus', 'the approaching ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'] with the harpoon, Commander Farragut had recognised in the supposed narwhal a submarine vessel, more dangerous than a supernatural cetacean. Yes, it must have been so; and on every sea they were now seeking this engine of destruction. Terrible indeed! if, as we supposed, ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'] employed ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus', 'the approaching ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'] in works of vengeance. On the night when ['we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] were imprisoned in that cell, in the midst of the Indian Ocean, had ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'] not attacked some vessel? ['The man buried in the coral cemetery', 'he'], had ['The man buried in the coral cemetery', 'he'] not been a victim to the shock caused by ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus', 'the approaching ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The vessel', 'the _Nautilus_']?_ Yes, ['my', 'I', 'me', 'Sir'] repeat it, it must be so. One part of the mysterious existence of ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'] had been unveiled; and, if ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'] identity had not been recognised, at least, ['the nations united against him', 'the['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'] were no longer hunting a chimerical creature, but a man who had vowed a deadly hatred against ['the nations united against him', 'them']. All the formidable past rose before ['my', 'I', 'me', 'Sir']. Instead of meeting friends on board ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus', 'the approaching ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'], ['we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] could only expect ['pitiless enemies', 'them', 'them', 'They']. But the shot rattled about ['we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we']. ['Some of them', 'themselv['pitiless enemies', 'them', 'them', 'They'] struck the sea and ricochetted, losing ['Some of them', 'themselves'] in the distance. But none touched ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus', 'the approaching ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The vessel', 'the _Nautilus_']. ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus', 'the approaching ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'] was not more than three miles from ['we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we']. In spite of the serious cannonade, ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'Captain Nemo', 'his', 'him', 'Captain Nemo'] did not appear on the platform; but, if one of the conical projectiles had ['struck', 'it'] the shell of ['the _Abraham Lincoln_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus', 'the approaching ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'], ['struck', 'it'] would have been fatal. ['the Canadian', 'The Canadian'] then said, “['my', 'I', 'me', 'Sir'], ['we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] must do all ['we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] can to get out of this dilemma. Let ['we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] signal ['pitiless enemies', 'them', 'them', 'They']. ['pitiless enemies', 'them', 'them', 'They'] will then, perhaps, understand that ['we', 'we', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'us', 'we'] are honest folks.” 
 
['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his'] took ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'hi['his handkerchief', 'it'] to wave in the air; but ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his'] had scarcely displayed ['his handkerchief', 'it'], when ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his'] was struck down by an iron hand, and fell, in spite of ['Ned Land', 'his', 'he', 'he', 'his'] great strength, upon the deck. 
 
“Fool!” exclaimed the Captain, “do you wish to be pierced by ['the spur of the _Nau['the _Nautilus_', 'this vessel'] before ['the spur of the _Nautilus_', 'it'] is hurled at ['the _Nautilus_', 'this vessel']?” 
 
['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] was terrible to hear; ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] was still more terrible to see. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] face was deadly pale, with ['a spasm at his hear['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] 'it']. For an instant ['a spasm at his heart', 'it'] must have ceased to beat. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] pupils were fearfully contracted. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] did not speak, ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] roared, as, with ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] body thrown forward, ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] wrung ['the Canadian’s', 'him'] shoulders. Then, leaving ['the Canadian’s', 'him'], and turning to ['the ship of war, whose shot was still raining around him', 'ship of an accursed nation', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'yo['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'], ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] exclaimed, with a powerful voice, “Ah, ['the ship of war, whose shot was still raining around him', 'ship of an accursed nation', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you'], ['the ship of war, whose shot was still raining around him', 'ship of an accursed nation', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you'] know who ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] am! ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] do not want ['the ship of war, whose shot was still raining around him', 'ship of an accursed nation', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you'] colours to know ['the ship of war, whose shot was still raining around him', 'ship of an accursed nation', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you'] by! Look! and ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine'] will show ['the ship of war, whose shot was still raining around him', 'ship of an accursed nation', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'you'] ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'His', 'his', 'His', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'mine']!” 
 
And on the fore part of the platform ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] unfurled a black flag, similar to the one ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] had placed at the South Pole. At that moment a shot struck ['the shell of the _Nautilus_', 'it'] obliquely, without piercing ['the shell of the _Nautilus_', 'it']; and, rebounding near ['the Captain', 'He', 'his'], was lost in the sea. ['the Captain', 'He', 'his'] shrugged ['the Captain', 'He', 'his'] shoulders; and, addressing ['me', 'you', 'your'], said shortly, “Go down, ['me', 'you', 'your'] and ['me', 'you', 'your'] companions, go down!” 
 
“['Sir', 'you'],” I cried, “are ['Sir', 'you'] going to attack this vessel?” 
 
“Sir, I am going to sink it.” 
 
“You will not do that?” 
 
“['I', 'he', 'I', 'me'] shall do it,” ['I', 'he', 'I', 'me'] replied coldly. “And ['I', 'he', 'I', 'me'] advise ['you', 'sir', 'you', 'you'] not to judge ['I', 'he', 'I', 'me'], ['you', 'sir', 'you', 'you']. Fate has shown ['you', 'sir', 'you', 'you'] what ['you', 'sir', 'you', 'you'] ought not to have seen. The attack has begun; go down.” 
 
“What is this vessel?” 
 
“['You', 'you'] do not know? Very well! so much the better! Its nationality to ['You', 'you'], at least, will be a secret. Go down!” 
 
We could but obey. ['About fifteen of the sailors', 'them'] surrounded ['the Captain', 'the Captain'], looking with implacable hatred at ['the vessel nearing them', 'the _Nautilu['About fifteen of the sailors', 'them']. One could feel that the same desire of vengeance animated every soul. ['I', 'I'] went down at the moment another projectile struck ['the vessel nearing them', 'the _Nautilus_'], and ['I', 'I'] heard ['the Captain', 'the Captain'] exclaim: 
 
“Strike, ['mad vessel', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'your']! Shower ['mad vessel', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'your'] useless shot! And then, ['mad vessel', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'your'] will not escape the spur of the _Nautilus_. But it is not here that ['mad vessel', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'your'] shall perish! I would not have ['mad vessel', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'your'] ruins mingle with those of the Avenger!” 
 
['I', 'my'] reached ['I', 'my'] room. ['The Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his'] and ['The Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his'] second had remained on the platform. The screw was set in motion, and ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s'], moving with speed, was soon beyond the reach of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship’s'] guns. But the pursuit continued, and ['The Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his'] contented ['The Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his'] with keeping ['The Captain', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his'] distance. 
 
About four in the afternoon, being no longer able to contain ['my', 'I', 'I'] impatience, ['my', 'I', 'I'] went to the central staircase. The panel was open, and ['my', 'I', 'I'] ventured on to the platform. ['The Captain', 'He'] was still walking up and down with an agitated step. ['The Captain', 'He'] was looking at the ship, which was five or six miles to leeward. 
 
['He', 'he', 'he', 'he'] was going round ['it', 'it'] like a wild beast, and, drawing ['it', 'it'] eastward, ['He', 'he', 'he', 'he'] allowed them to pursue. But ['He', 'he', 'he', 'he'] did not attack. Perhaps ['He', 'he', 'he', 'he'] still hesitated? ['I', 'I'] wished to mediate once more. But ['I', 'I'] had scarcely spoken, when Captain Nemo imposed silence, saying: 
 
“['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am the law, and ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am the judge! ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] am the oppressed, and there is ['the oppressor', 'him']! Through ['the oppressor', 'him'] ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] have lost ['all that I loved, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']herished, and venerated—country, wife, children, father, and mother', 'all']. ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] saw ['all that I loved, cherished, and venerated—country, wife, children, father, and mother', 'all'] perish! All that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] hate is there! Say no more!” 
 
I cast a last look at the man-of-war, which was putting on steam, and rejoined Ned and Conseil. 
 
“We will fly!” I exclaimed. 
 
“Good!” said Ned. “What is this vessel?” 
 
“I do not know; but, whatever ['it', 'it', 'it'] is, ['it', 'it', 'it'] will be sunk before night. In any case, it is better to perish with ['it', 'it', 'it'], than be made accomplices in a retaliation the justice of which we cannot judge.” 
 
“That is ['my', 'Ned Land'] opinion too,” said ['my', 'Ned Land'], coolly. “Let us wait for night.” 
 
Night arrived. Deep silence reigned on board. The compass showed that ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'the vessel', 'the ship', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'his adversary', 'it'] had not altered ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'the vessel', 'the ship', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'his adversary', 'it'] course. ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'the vessel', 'the ship', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'his adversary', 'it'] was on the surface, rolling slightly. ['My', 'I', 'I['My companions and I', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we'['My', 'I', 'I'] resolved to fly when ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'the vessel', 'the ship', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'his adversary', 'it'] should be near enough either to hear ['My companions and I', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we'] or to see ['My companions and I', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we']; for the moon, which would be full in two or three days, shone brightly. Once on board ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'the vessel', 'the ship', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'his adversary', 'it'], if ['My companions and I', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we'] could not prevent the blow which threatened ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'the vessel', 'the ship', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'his adversary', 'it'], ['My companions and I', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we'] could, at least ['My companions and I', 'us', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we'] would, do all that circumstances would allow. Several times ['My', 'I', 'I'] thought ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'the vessel', 'the ship', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'his adversary', 'it'] was preparing for attack; but ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his'] contented ['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his'] with allowing ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'the vessel', 'the ship', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'his adve['Captain Nemo', 'himself', 'his']ry', 'it'] to approach, and then fled once more before ['the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'It', 'the vessel', 'the ship', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_', 'his adversary', 'it']. 
 
Part of the night passed without any incident. ['We', 'We', 'we'] watched the opportunity for action. ['We', 'We', 'we'] spoke little, for ['We', 'We', 'we'] were too much moved. ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'him'] would have thrown ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'him'] into the sea, but ['I', 'my'] forced ['Ned Land', 'himself', 'him'] to wait. According to ['I', 'my'] idea, ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship', 'her'] would attack ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship', 'her'] at ['the _Nautilus_', 'the ship', 'her'] waterline, and then it would not only be possible, but easy to fly. 
 
At three in the morning, full of uneasiness, ['I', 'I', 'I'] mounted ['the platform', 'it', 'the vessel', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_']. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] had not left ['the platform', 'it', 'the vessel', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_']. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] was standing at the fore part near ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] flag, which a slight breeze displayed above ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] head. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] did not take ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] eyes from ['the platform', 'it', 'the vessel', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_']. The intensity of ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'h['his look', 'it'] seemed to attract, and fascinate, and draw ['his look', 'it'] onward more surely than if ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'He', 'his', 'his', 'he'] had been towing ['the platform', 'it', 'the vessel', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_']. The moon was then passing the meridian. Jupiter was rising in the east. Amid this peaceful scene of nature, ['sky and ocean', 'these elements'] rivalled each other in tranquillity, the sea offering to ['the orbs of night', 'they', 'their'] the finest mirror ['the orbs of night', 'they', 'their'] could ever have in which to reflect ['the orbs of night', 'they', 'their'] image. As ['I', 'I', 'I'] thought of the deep calm of ['sky and ocean', 'these elements'], compared with all those passions brooding imperceptibly within ['the platform', 'it', 'the vessel', 'it', 'the _Nautilus_'], ['I', 'I', 'I'] shuddered. 
 
['The vessel', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'its'] was within two miles of us. ['The vessel', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'its'] was ever nearing that phosphorescent light which showed the presence of ['The vessel', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'its']. I could see ['The vessel', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'its'] green and red lights, and ['The vessel', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'its'] white lantern hanging from the large foremast. An indistinct vibration quivered through ['The vessel', 'It', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'its', 'its'] rigging, showing that the furnaces were heated to the uttermost. Sheaves of sparks and red ashes flew from the funnels, shining in the atmosphere like stars. 
 
['I', 'me', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] remained thus until six in the morning, without ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] noticing ['I', 'me', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I']. ['The ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'this man', 'The _Nautilus_'] stood about a mile and a half from us, and with the first dawn of day the firing began afresh. The moment could not be far off when, ['The ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'this man', 'The _Nautilus_'] attacking ['The ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'this man', 'The _Nautilus_'] adversary, ['I', 'me', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I['my companions and myself', 'them', '['I', 'me', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] should for ever leave ['The ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'this man', 'The _Nautilus_']. ['I', 'me', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] was preparing to go down to remind ['my companions and myself', 'them', 'them'], when the second mounted ['the platform', 'the platform'], accompanied by several sailors. ['Captain Nemo', 'Captain Nemo'] either did not or would not see ['my companions and myself', 'them', 'them']. ['Some steps', 'They'] were taken which might be called the signal for action. ['Some steps', 'They'] were very simple. The iron balustrade around ['the platform', 'the platform'] was lowered, and ['the lantern and pilot cages', 'they'] were pushed within the shell until ['the lantern and pilot cages', 'they'] were flush with the deck. The long surface of ['the steel cigar', 'its'] no longer offered a single point to check ['the steel cigar', 'its'] manœuvres. ['I', 'me', 'my', 'myself', 'I', 'I'] returned to the saloon. ['The ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'this man', 'The _Nautilus_'] still floated; some streaks of light were filtering through the liquid beds. With the undulations of the waves the windows were brightened by the red streaks of the rising sun, and this dreadful day of the 2nd of June had dawned. 
 
At five o’clock, the log showed that the speed of the _Nautilus_ was ['slackening', 'it'], and I knew that ['slackening', 'it'] was allowing them to draw nearer. Besides, the reports were heard more distinctly, and the projectiles, labouring through the ambient water, were extinguished with a strange hissing noise. 
 
“['My', 'I'] friends,” said ['My', 'I'], “the moment is come. One grasp of the hand, and may God protect us!” 
 
Ned Land was resolute, Conseil calm, ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] so nervous that ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] knew not how to contain ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I']. ['We all', 'al['We all', 'all'] passed into the library; but the moment ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] pushed the door opening on to ['the central staircase', 'the stairs'], ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] heard the upper panel close sharply. ['The Canadian', 'him'] rushed on to ['the central staircase', 'the stairs'], but ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] stopped ['The Canadian', 'him']. A well-known hissing noise told ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] that the water was running into the reservoirs, and in a few minutes ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] was some yards beneath the surface of the waves. ['myself', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] understood the manœuvre. It was too late to act. ['the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] did not wish to strike at ['the impenetrable cuirass', 'it'], but below the water-line, where the metallic covering no longer protected ['the impenetrable cuirass', 'it']. 
 
['We', 'We', 'we'] were again imprisoned, unwilling witnesses of the dreadful drama that was preparing. ['We', 'We', 'we'] had scarcely time to reflect; taking refuge in ['my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] room, ['We', 'We', 'we'] looked at each other without speaking. A deep stupor had taken hold of ['my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] mind: thought seemed to stand still. ['my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] was in that painful state of expectation preceding a dreadful report. ['my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] waited, ['my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] listened, every sense was merged in that of hearing! The speed of ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'The whole ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the vessel'] was accelerated. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'The whole ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the vessel'] was preparing to rush. ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'The whole ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the vessel'] trembled. Suddenly ['my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] screamed. ['my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] felt the shock, but comparatively light. ['my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] felt the penetrating power of the steel spur. ['my', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] heard rattlings and scrapings. But ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'The whole ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the vessel'], carried along by ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'The whole ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the vessel'] propelling power, passed through the mass of ['the _Nautilus_', 'It', 'The whole ship', 'the _Nautilus_', 'its', 'the vessel'] like a needle through sailcloth! 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] could stand it no longer. Mad, out of ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] mind, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] rushed from ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] room into the saloon. ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] was there, mute, gloomy, implacable; ['Captain Nemo', 'he'] was looking through the port panel. ['A large mass', 'it', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_', 'her'] cast a shadow on ['the water', 'the water']; and, that ['A large mass', 'it', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_', 'her'] might lose nothing of ['A large mass', 'it', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_', 'her'] agony, ['A large mass', 'it', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_', 'her'] was going down into the abyss with ['A large mass', 'it', 'her', 'the _Nautilus_', 'her']. Ten yards from ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] ['I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I'] saw the open shell, through which ['the water', 'the water'] was rushing with the noise of thunder, then the double line of guns and the netting. The bridge was covered with black, agitated shadows. 
 
['The water', 'the water'] was rising. The poor creatures were crowding the ratlines, clinging to the masts, struggling under ['The water', 'the water']. It was a human ant-heap overtaken by the sea. Paralysed, stiffened with anguish, ['my', 'I', 'me'] hair standing on end, with eyes wide open, panting, without breath, and without voice, ['my', 'I', 'me'] too was watching! An irresistible attraction glued ['my', 'I', 'me'] to the glass! Suddenly an explosion took place. The compressed air blew up ['her', 'the unfortunate vessel', 'Her', 'her', 'her'] decks, as if the magazines had caught fire. Then ['her', 'the unfortunate vessel', 'Her', 'her', 'her'] sank more rapidly. ['her', 'the unfortunate vessel', 'Her', 'her', 'her'] topmast, laden with victims, now appeared; then ['her', 'the unfortunate vessel', 'Her', 'her', 'her'] spars, bending under the weight of men; and, last of all, the top of ['her', 'the unfortunate vessel', 'Her', 'her', 'her'] mainmast. Then ['the dark mass', 'it'] disappeared, and with ['the dark mass', 'it'] the dead crew, drawn down by the strong eddy. 
 
[Illustration] The unfortunate vessel sank more rapidly 
 
['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] turned to ['Captain Nemo', 'That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel of hatred', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his']. ['Captain Nemo', 'That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel of hatred', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'], was still looking. When all was over, ['Captain Nemo', 'That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel of hatred', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] turned to ['Captain Nemo', 'That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel of hatred', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] room, opened the door, and entered. ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] followed ['Captain Nemo', 'That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel of hatred', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] with ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] eyes. On the end wall beneath ['Captain Nemo', 'That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel of hatred', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] heroes, ['I', 'I', 'my', 'I'] saw the portrait of ['a woman, still young, and two little children', 'them', 'them']. ['Captain Nemo', 'That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel of hatred', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] looked at ['a woman, still young, and two little children', 'them', 'them'] for some moments, stretched ['Captain Nemo', 'That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel of hatred', 'he', 'his', 'him', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] arms towards ['a woman, still young, and two little children', 'them', 'them'], and, kneeling down, burst into deep sobs. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXII THE LAST WORDS OF CAPTAIN NEMO 
 
The panels had closed on this dreadful vision, but light had not returned to ['the saloon', 'the saloon', 'It']: all was silence and darkness within ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_']. At wonderful speed, a hundred feet beneath the water, ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] was leaving this desolate spot. Whither was ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] going? To the north or south? Where was ['the man', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] flying to after such dreadful retaliation? ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] had returned to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I['my room, where Ned and Conse['Ned and Conseil', 'thes['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'he', 'himself'] silent enough', 'my room']. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] felt an insurmountable horror for ['the man', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his']. Whatever ['the man', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] had suffered at the hands of ['Ned and Conseil', 'these men'], ['the man', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] had no right to punish thus. ['the man', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] had made ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'], if not an accomplice, at least a witness of ['the man', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] vengeance. At eleven the electric light reappeared. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] passed into ['the saloon', 'the saloon', 'It']. ['the saloon', 'the saloon', 'It'] was deserted. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] consulted the different instruments. ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] was flying northward at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour, now on ['the surface', 'it'], and now thirty feet below ['the surface', 'it']. On taking the bearings by the chart, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] saw that ['we', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] were passing the mouth of the Manche, and that ['we', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] course was hurrying ['we', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] towards the northern seas at a frightful speed. That night ['we', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] had crossed two hundred leagues of ['the Atlantic', 'the sea']. The shadows fell, and ['the Atlantic', 'the sea'] was covered with darkness until the rising of the moon. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] went to ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I['my room, where Ned and Conseil had remained silent enough', 'my room'], but could not sleep. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] was troubled with dreadful nightmare. The horrible scene of destruction was continually before ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] eyes. From that day, who could tell into what part of the North Atlantic basin ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] would take ['we', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We']? Still with unaccountable speed. Still in the midst of these northern fogs. Would ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] touch at Spitzbergen, or on the shores of Nova Zembla? Should ['we', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] explore those unknown seas, the White Sea, the Sea of Kara, the Gulf of Obi, the Archipelago of Liarrov, and the unknown coast of Asia? ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] could not say. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] could no longer judge of the time that was passing. The clocks had been stopped on board. It seemed, as in polar countries, ['that night and day', 'their'] no longer followed ['that night and day', 'their'] regular course. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] felt ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] being drawn into that strange region where the foundered imagination of Edgar Poe roamed at will. Like the fabulous Gordon Pym, at every moment ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] expected to see “that veiled human figure, of larger proportions than those of any inhabitant of the earth, thrown across the cataract which defends the approach to the pole.” ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] estimated (though, perhaps, ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] may be mistaken)—I estimated ['this adventurous course of the _Nautilus_', 'it', ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] to have lasted fifteen or twenty days. And ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] know not how much longer ['this adventurous course of the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'this voyage'] might have lasted, had it not been for the catastrophe which ended ['this adventurous course of the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'this voyage']. Of ['the man', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] saw nothing whatever now, nor of ['the man', 'Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] second. Not a man of the crew was visible for an instant. ['the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'it', 'The _Nautilus_', 'the _Nautilus_', 'it', 'the _Nautilus', 'the _Nautilus_', 'The _Nautilus_'] was almost incessantly under water. When ['we', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] came to the surface to renew the air, the panels opened and shut mechanically. There were no more marks on the planisphere. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] knew not where ['we', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] were. And ['the Canadian', 'his', 'him', 'him'], too, ['the Canadian', 'his', 'him', 'him'] strength and patience at an end, appeared no more. ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'he', 'himself'] could not draw a word from ['the Canadian', 'his', 'him', 'him']; and, fearing that, in a dreadful fit of madness, ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'he', 'himself'] might kill ['Conseil', 'Conseil', 'he', 'himself'], watched ['the Canadian', 'his', 'him', 'him'] with constant devotion. One morning (what date it was ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] could not say) ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] had fallen into ['a heavy sleep', 'a sleep both painful and unhealthy'] towards the early hours, ['a heavy sleep', 'a sleep both painful and unhealthy'], when ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] suddenly awoke. Ned Land was leaning over ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'], saying, in a low voice, “['we', 'our', 'us', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'We'] are going to fly.” ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I'] sat up. 
 
“When shall we go?” I asked. 
 
“To-night. All inspection on board the _Nautilus_ seems to have ceased. All appear to be stupefied. ['You', 'sir'] will be ready, ['You', 'sir']?” 
 
“Yes; where are we?” 
 
“In sight of land. I took the reckoning this morning in the fog—twenty miles to the east.” 
 
“What country is it?” 
 
“I do not know; but, whatever it is, we will take refuge there.” 
 
“Yes, Ned, yes. ['We', 'us'] will fly to-night, even if the sea should swallow ['We', 'us'] up.” 
 
“The sea is bad, the wind violent, but twenty miles in that light boat of the _Nautilus_ does not frighten ['me', 'I']. Unknown to the crew, ['me', 'I'] have been able to procure food and some bottles of water.” 
 
“I will follow you.” 
 
“But,” continued ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'me'], “if ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'me'] am surprised, ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'me'] will defend ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'me']; ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'me'] will force them to kill ['the Canadian', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'me'].” 
 
“We will die together, friend Ned.” 
 
['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] had made up ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] mind to all. The Canadian left ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my']. ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] reached the platform, on which ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] could with difficulty support ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] against the shock of the waves. The sky was threatening; but, as land was in those thick brown shadows, we must fly. ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] returned to the saloon, fearing and yet hoping to see ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'him'], wishing and yet not wishing to see ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'him']. What could ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] have said to ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'him']? Could ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] hide the involuntary horror with which ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'him'] inspired ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my']? No. It was better that ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] should not meet ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'him'] face to face; better to forget ['Captain Nemo', 'him', 'him', 'he', 'him', 'him']. And yet—— How long seemed that day, the last that ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] should pass in the _Nautilus_. ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] remained alone. ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'themselves', 'We', 'our', 'W['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'I']seil ['Conseil', 'Conseil'] avoided speaking, for fear of betraying ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'themselves', 'We', 'our', 'We', 'Conseil and I']. At six ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] dined, but ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] was not hungry; ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] forced ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] to eat in spite of ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] disgust, that ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] might not weaken ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my']. At half-past six ['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'I'] came to ['I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'myself', 'my'] room, saying, “['Ned Land and Conseil', 'themselves', 'We', 'our', 'We', 'Conseil and I'] shall not see each other again before ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'themselves', 'We', 'our', 'We', 'Conseil and I'] departure. At ten the moon will not be risen. ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'themselves', 'We', 'our', 'We', 'Conseil and I'] will profit by the darkness. Come to the boat; ['Ned Land and Conseil', 'themselves', 'We', 'our', 'We', 'Co['Conseil', 'Conseil']nd I'['Ned Land', 'Ned Land', 'I'] will wait for you.” 
 
The Canadian went out without giving ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] time to answer. Wishing to verify the course of the _Nautilus_, ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] went to the saloon. We were running N.N.E. at frightful speed, and more than fifty yards deep. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] cast a last look on these wonders of nature, on the riches of art heaped up in this museum, upon ['the unrivalled collection destined to perish at the bottom of the sea, with him who had formed it', 'it', 'it['the unrivalled collection destined to perish at the bottom of the sea, with him who had formed it', 'it', 'it']. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] wished to fix an indelible impression of ['the unrivalled collection destined to perish at the bottom of the sea, with him who had formed it', 'it', 'it'] in ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] mind. ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] remained an hour thus, bathed in the light of that luminous ceiling, and passing in review ['those treasures shining under their glass['those treasures shining under their glasses', 'their']'their']. Then ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] returned to ['me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'I', 'my'] room. 
 
['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] dressed ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] in strong sea clothing. ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] collected ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself['my notes', 'them'], placing ['my notes', 'them'] carefully about ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself']. ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself['My heart', 'its'] beat loudly. ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] could not check ['My heart', 'its'] pulsations. Certainly ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] trouble and agitation would have betrayed ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] to ['Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'the Captain’s', 'him', 'him'] eyes. What was ['Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'the Captain’s', 'him', 'him'] doing at this moment? ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] listened at the door of ['Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'the Captain’s', 'him', 'hi['his room', 'the Captain’s room']. ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] heard steps. ['Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'the Captain’s', 'him', 'him'] was there. ['Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'the Captain’s', 'him', 'him'] had not gone to rest. At every moment ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] expected to see ['Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'the Captain’s', 'him', 'him'] appear, and ask ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] why ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] wished to fly. ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] was constantly on the alert. ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] imagination magnified everything. The impression became at last so poignant that ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] asked ['I', 'myself', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'My', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'My', 'I', 'myself'] if it would not be better to go to ['Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'the Captain’s', ['his room', 'the Captain’s room'], see ['Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'the Captain’s', 'him', 'him'] face to face, and brave ['Captain Nemo’s', 'he', 'his', 'Captain Nemo', 'He', 'him', 'the Captain’s', 'him', 'him'] with look and gesture. 
 
It was the inspiration of a madman; fortunately ['I', 'myself', 'my', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] resisted the desire, and stretched ['I', 'myself', 'my', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] on ['I', 'myself', 'my', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] bed to quiet ['I', 'myself', 'my', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] bodily agitation. ['I', 'myself', 'my', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] nerves were somewhat calmer, but in ['I', 'myself', 'my', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] excited brain ['I', 'myself', 'my', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] saw over again all ['I', 'myself', 'my', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] existence on board ['the _Nautilus', 'the vessel', 'her'];_ every incident, either happy or unfortunate, which had happened since ['I', 'myself', 'my', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] disappearance from the _Abraham Lincoln_—the submarine hunt, the Torres Straits, the savages of Papua, the running ashore, the coral cemetery, the passage of Suez, the Island of Santorin, the Cretan diver, Vigo Bay, Atlantis, the iceberg, the South Pole, the imprisonment in the ice, the fight among the poulps, the storm in the Gulf Stream, the Avenger, and the horrible scene of ['the _Nautilus', 'the vessel', 'her'] sunk with all ['the _Nautilus', 'the vessel', 'her'] crew. All these events passed before ['I', 'myself', 'my', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] eyes like scenes in a drama. Then ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He'] seemed to grow enormously, ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He'] features to assume superhuman proportions. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He'] was no longer ['I', 'myself', 'my', 'my', 'My', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'my', 'my', 'my'] equal, but a man of the waters, the genie of the sea. 
 
It was then half-past nine. ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] held ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me['my head', 'it'] between ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] hands to keep ['my head', 'it'] from bursting. ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] closed ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] eyes; ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] would not think any longer. There was another half-hour to wait, another half-hour of a nightmare, which might drive ['I', 'my', 'my', 'I', 'my', 'I', 'me'] mad. 
 
At that moment ['I', 'I'] heard the distant strains of the organ, a sad harmony to an undefinable chant, the wail of a soul longing to break these earthly bonds. ['I', 'I'] listened with every sense, scarcely breathing; plunged, like ['Captain Nemo', 'him'], in that musical ecstasy, which was drawing ['Captain Nemo', 'him'] in spirit to the end of life. 
 
Then a sudden thought terrified ['me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'me']. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his'] had left ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his'] room. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his'] was in the saloon, which ['me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'me'] must cross to fly. There ['me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'me'] should meet ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his'] for the last time. ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his'] would see ['me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'me'], perhaps speak to ['me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'me']. A gesture of ['Captain Nemo', 'his', 'He', 'him', 'He', 'his'] might destroy ['me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'me'], a single word chain ['me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'me', 'me', 'me'] on board. 
 
But ten was about to strike. The moment had come for ['me', 'my', 'my'] to leave ['me', 'my', 'my'] room, and join ['me', 'my', 'my'] companions. 
 
['I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] must not hesitate, even if Captain Nemo himself should rise before ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my']. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] opened ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my['my door', 'it', 'its', 'it'] carefully; and even then, as ['my door', 'it', 'its', 'it'] turned on ['my door', 'it', 'its', 'it'] hinges, ['my door', 'it', 'its', 'it'] seemed to ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] to make ['a dreadful noise', 'it']. Perhaps ['a dreadful noise', 'it'] only existed in ['I', 'me', 'I', 'my', 'me', 'my'] own imagination. 
 
['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] crept along the dark stairs of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the saloon'], stopping at each step to check the beating of ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] heart. ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] reached ['the door of the saloon', '['the _Nautilus_', 'the saloon'], and opened ['the door of the saloon', 'it', 'It'] gently. ['the door of the saloon', 'it', 'It'] was plunged in profound darkness. The strains of the organ sounded faintly. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he'] was there. ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he'] did not see ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me']. In the full light ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'] do not think ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he'] would have noticed ['I', 'my', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'me'], so entirely was ['Captain Nemo', 'He', 'he', 'he'] absorbed in the ecstasy. 
 
['I', 'my', 'I'] crept along the carpet, avoiding the slightest sound which might betray ['I', 'my', 'I'] presence. ['I', 'my', 'I'] was at least five minutes reaching the door, at the opposite side, opening into the library. 
 
['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] was going to open it, when a sigh from ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'His', 'him'] nailed ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] to the spot. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] knew that ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'His', 'him'] was rising. ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] could even see ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'His', 'him'], for the light from the library came through to the saloon. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'His', 'him'] came towards ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] silently, with ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'His', 'him'] arms crossed, gliding like a spectre rather than walking. ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'His', 'him'] breast was swelling with sobs; and ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] heard ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'his', 'His', 'him'] murmur these words (the last which ever struck ['I', 'me', 'I', 'I', 'me', 'I', 'my'] ear): 
 
“Almighty God! enough! enough!” 
 
Was it a confession of remorse which thus escaped from this man’s conscience? 
 
In desperation, ['I', 'I', 'my'] rushed through the library, mounted the central staircase, and, following the upper flight, reached the boat. ['I', 'I', 'my'] crept through the opening, which had already admitted ['I', 'I', 'my'] two companions. 
 
“Let ['us', 'us'] go! let ['us', 'us'] go!” I exclaimed. 
 
“Directly!” replied the Canadian. 
 
The orifice in the plates of ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat', 'the submarine boat'] was first closed, and fastened down by means of a false key, with which ['Ned Land', 'himself'] had provided ['Ned Land', 'himself']; the opening in ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat', 'the submarine boat'] was also closed. The Canadian began to loosen the bolts which still held us to ['the _Nautilus_', 'the boat', 'the submarine boat']. 
 
Suddenly a noise was heard. ['Voices', 'they'] were answering each other loudly. What was the matter? Had ['Voices', 'they'] discovered our flight? ['I', 'my'] felt Ned Land slipping a dagger into ['I', 'my'] hand. 
 
“Yes,” I murmured, “we know how to die!” 
 
['The Canadian', 'his'] had stopped in ['The Canadian', 'his'] work. But ['one word many times repeated, a dreadful word', 'a ['one word many times repeated, a dreadful word', 'a dreadful word'], revealed ['the cause of the agitation spreading on board the _Nautilus_', 'It']. ['the cause of the agitation spreading on board the _Nautilus_', 'It'] was not we the crew were looking after! 
 
“The maelstrom! the maelstrom!” Could a more dreadful word in a more dreadful situation have sounded in ['our', 'We', 'our', 'We'] ears! ['our', 'We', 'our', 'We'] were then upon the dangerous coast of Norway. Was the _Nautilus_ being drawn into ['this gulf', 'a gulf justly called the “Navel of the Ocean,” whose power of attraction extends to a distance of twelve miles'] at the moment ['our', 'We', 'our', 'W['our boat', 'its'] was going to leave ['our boat', 'its'] sides? ['our', 'We', 'our', 'We'] knew that at the tide the pent-up waters between the islands of Ferroe and Loffoden rush with irresistible violence, forming a whirlpool from which no vessel ever escapes. From every point of the horizon enormous waves were meeting, forming ['this gulf', 'a gulf justly called the “Navel of the Ocean,” whose power of attraction extends to a distance of twelve miles']. There, not only vessels, but whales are sacrificed, as well as white bears from the northern regions. 
 
It is thither that the _Nautilus_, voluntarily or involuntarily, had been run by the Captain. 
 
It was describing a spiral, the circumference of which was lessening by degrees, and ['the boat, which was still fastened to its side'['the boat, which was still fastened to its side', 'its']its'], was carried along with giddy speed. I felt that sickly giddiness which arises from long-continued whirling round. 
 
['We', 'Our', 'we', 'our'] were in dread. ['We', 'Our', 'we', 'ou['Our horror', 'its'] was at ['Our horror', 'its'] height, circulation had stopped, all nervous influence was annihilated, and ['We', 'Our', 'we', 'our'] were covered with cold sweat, like a sweat of agony! And what noise around ['We', 'Our', 'we', 'our'] frail bark! What roarings repeated by the echo miles away! What an uproar was that of the waters broken on the sharp rocks at the bottom, where the hardest bodies are crushed, and trees worn away, “with all the fur rubbed off,” according to the Norwegian phrase! 
 
What a situation to be in! ['We', 'we'] rocked frightfully. ['The _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'Its', 'it', 'it'] defended ['The _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'Its', 'it', 'it'] like a human being. ['The _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'Its', 'it', 'it'] steel muscles cracked. Sometimes ['The _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'Its', 'it', 'it'] seemed to stand upright, and ['We', 'we'] with ['The _Nautilus_', 'itself', 'Its', 'it', 'it']! 
 
“['We', 'We', 'we'] must hold on,” said Ned, “and look after the bolts. ['We', 'We', 'we'] may still be saved if ['We', 'We', 'we'] stick to the _Nautilus_.” 
 
He had not finished the words, when we heard a crashing noise, the bolts gave way, and ['the boat', 'its'], torn from ['the boat', 'its'] groove, was hurled like a stone from a sling into the midst of the whirlpool. 
 
['My', 'I'] head struck on a piece of iron, and with the violent shock ['My', 'I'] lost all consciousness. 
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXIII CONCLUSION 
 
Thus ends the voyage under the seas. What passed during that night—how the boat escaped from the eddies of the maelstrom—how Ned Land, Conseil, and ['myself', 'I'] ever came out of the gulf, ['myself', 'I'] cannot tell. 
 
But when ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my'] returned to consciousness, ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my'] was lying in a fisherman’s hut, on the Loffoden Isles. ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my['My two companions', 'We'], safe and sound, were near ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my'] holding ['I', 'I', 'My', 'me', 'my'] hands. ['My two companions', 'We'] embraced each other heartily. 
 
At that moment we could not think of returning to France. The means of communication between the north of Norway and the south are rare. And I am therefore obliged to wait for the steamboat running monthly from Cape North. 
 
And, among the worthy people who have so kindly received us, ['I', 'my'] revise ['I', 'my['my record of these adventures', 'It'] once more. Not a fact has been omitted, not a detail exaggerated. ['my record of these adventures', 'It'] is a faithful narrative of this incredible expedition in an element inaccessible to man, but to which Progress will one day open a road. 
 
Shall ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] be believed? ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] do not know. And it matters little, after all. What ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] now affirm is, that ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] have a right to speak of these seas, under which, in less than ten months, ['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I'] have crossed 20,000 leagues in that submarine tour of the world, which has revealed so many wonders. 
 
But what has become of ['the _Nautilus', 'it']?_ Did ['the _Nautilus', 'it'] resist the pressure of the maelstrom? Does ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he'] still live? And does ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he'] still follow under the ocean those frightful retaliations? Or, did ['Captain Nemo', 'he', 'he'] stop after the last hecatomb? 
 
Will the waves one day carry to ['him', 'his', 'this man'] this manuscript containing the history of ['him', 'his', 'this man'] life? Shall I ever know the name of ['him', 'his', 'this man']? Will ['the missing vessel', 'its'] tell us by ['the missing vessel', 'its'] nationality that of Captain Nemo? 
 
['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] hope so. And ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] also hope that ['his powerful vessel'['his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his']the _Nautilus_'] has conquered ['the sea at its most ['the sea at its most terrible gulf', 'its']rible gulf', 'its'], and that ['his powerful vessel', 'the _Nautilus_'] has survived where so many other vessels have been lost! If it be so—if ['his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] still inhabits the ocean, ['his', 'Captain Nemo', 'his'] adopted country, may hatred be appeased in that savage heart! May the contemplation of so many wonders extinguish for ever the spirit of vengeance! May the judge disappear, and ['the philosopher', 'his'] continue the peaceful exploration of the sea! If ['the philosopher', 'hi['his destiny', 'it', 'it'] be strange, ['his destiny', 'it', 'it'] is also sublime. Have ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] not understood ['his destiny', 'it', 'it'] ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I']? Have ['I', 'I', 'I', 'myself', 'I'] not lived ten months of this unnatural life? And to the question asked by Ecclesiastes three thousand years ago, “['That which is far off and exceeding deep', 'it'], who can find ['That which is far off and exceeding deep', 'it'] out?” two men alone of all now living have the right to give an answer—— 
 
CAPTAIN NEMO AND MYSELF.
