But one circumstance happened which showed the\nwonderful dexterity of Ned Land, and proved what confidence we might\nplace in him.\n\nThe 30th of June, the frigate spoke some American whalers, from whom we\nlearned that they knew nothing about the narwhal. But one of them, the\ncaptain of the _Monroe_, knowing that Ned Land had shipped on board the\n_Abraham Lincoln_, begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in\nsight. Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing Ned Land at work, gave\nhim permission to go on board the _Monroe_. And fate served our\nCanadian so well that, instead of one whale, he harpooned two with a\ndouble blow, striking one straight to the heart, and catching the other\nafter some minutes’ pursuit.\n\nDecidedly, if the monster ever had to do with Ned Land’s harpoon, I\nwould not bet in its favour.\n\nThe frigate skirted the south-east coast of America with great\nrapidity. The 3rd of July we were at the opening of the Straits of\nMagellan, level with Cape Vierges. But Commander Farragut would not\ntake a tortuous passage, but doubled Cape Horn.\n\nThe ship’s crew agreed with him. And certainly it was possible that\nthey might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass. Many of the sailors\naffirmed that the monster could not pass there, “that he was too big\nfor that!”\n\nThe 6th of July, about three o’clock in the afternoon, the _Abraham\nLincoln_, at fifteen miles to the south, doubled the solitary island,\nthis lost rock at the extremity of the American continent, to which\nsome Dutch sailors gave the name of their native town, Cape Horn. The\ncourse was taken towards the north-west, and the next day the screw of\nthe frigate was at last beating the waters of the Pacific.\n\n“Keep your eyes open!” called out the sailors.\n\nAnd they were opened widely. Both eyes and glasses, a little dazzled,\nit is true, by the prospect of two thousand dollars, had not an\ninstant’s repose. Day and night they watched the surface of the ocean,\nand even nyctalopes, whose faculty of seeing in the darkness multiplies\ntheir chances a hundredfold, would have had enough to do to gain the\nprize.\n\nI myself, for whom money had no charms, was not the least attentive on\nboard. Giving but few minutes to my meals, but a few hours to sleep,\nindifferent to either rain or sunshine, I did not leave the poop of the\nvessel. Now leaning on the netting of the forecastle, now on the\ntaffrail, I devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the\nsea as far as the eye could reach; and how often have I shared the\nemotion of the majority of the crew, when some capricious whale raised\nits black back above the waves! The poop of the vessel was crowded in a\nmoment. The cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers, each\nwith heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of the\ncetacean. I looked and looked, till I was nearly blind, whilst Conseil,\nalways phlegmatic, kept repeating in a calm voice:\n\n“If, sir, you would not squint so much, you would see better!”\n\nBut vain excitement! The _Abraham Lincoln_ checked its speed and made\nfor the animal signalled, a simple whale, or common cachalot, which\nsoon disappeared amidst a storm of execration.\n\nBut the weather was good. The voyage was being accomplished under the\nmost favourable auspices. It was then the bad season in Australia, the\nJuly of that zone corresponding to our January in Europe, but the sea\nwas beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference.\n\nThe 20th of July, the tropic of Capricorn was cut by 105° of longitude,\nand the 27th of the same month we crossed the equator on the 110th\nmeridian. This passed, the frigate took a more decided westerly\ndirection, and scoured the central waters of the Pacific. Commander\nFarragut thought, and with reason, that it was better to remain in deep\nwater, and keep clear of continents or islands, which the beast itself\nseemed to shun (perhaps because there was not enough water for him!\nsuggested the greater part of the crew). The frigate passed at some\ndistance from the Marquesas and the Sandwich Islands, crossed the\ntropic of Cancer, and made for the China Seas. We were on the theatre\nof the last diversions of the monster: and, to say truth, we no longer\n_lived_ on board. Hearts palpitated, fearfully preparing themselves for\nfuture incurable aneurism. The entire ship’s crew were undergoing a\nnervous excitement, of which I can give no idea: they could not eat,\nthey could not sleep—twenty times a day, a misconception or an optical\nillusion of some sailor seated on the taffrail, would cause dreadful\nperspirations, and these emotions, twenty times repeated, kept us in a\nstate of excitement so violent that a reaction was unavoidable.\n\nAnd truly, reaction soon showed itself. For three months, during which\na day seemed an age, the _Abraham Lincoln_ furrowed all the waters of\nthe Northern Pacific, running at whales, making sharp deviations from\nher course, veering suddenly from one tack to another, stopping\nsuddenly, putting on steam, and backing ever and anon at the risk of\nderanging her machinery, and not one point of the Japanese or American\ncoast was left unexplored.\n\nThe warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent\ndetractors. Reaction mounted from the crew to the captain himself, and\ncertainly, had it not been for resolute determination on the part of\nCaptain Farragut, the frigate would have headed due southward. This\nuseless search could not last much longer. The _Abraham Lincoln_ had\nnothing to reproach herself with, she had done her best to succeed.\nNever had an American ship’s crew shown more zeal or patience; its\nfailure could not be placed to their charge—there remained nothing but\nto return.\n\nThis was represented to the commander. The sailors could not hide their\ndiscontent, and the service suffered. I will not say there was a mutiny\non board, but after a reasonable period of obstinacy, Captain Farragut\n(as Columbus did) asked for three days’ patience. If in three days the\nmonster did not appear, the man at the helm should give three turns of\nthe wheel, and the _Abraham Lincoln_ would make for the European seas.\n\nThis promise was made on the 2nd of November. It had the effect of\nrallying the ship’s crew. The ocean was watched with renewed attention.\nEach one wished for a last glance in which to sum up his remembrance.\nGlasses were used with feverish activity. It was a grand defiance given\nto the giant narwhal, and he could scarcely fail to answer the summons\nand “appear.”\n\nTwo days passed, the steam was at half pressure; a thousand schemes\nwere tried to attract the attention and stimulate the apathy of the\nanimal in case it should be met in those parts. Large quantities of\nbacon were trailed in the wake of the ship, to the great satisfaction\n(I must say) of the sharks. Small craft radiated in all directions\nround the _Abraham Lincoln_ as she lay to, and did not leave a spot of\nthe sea unexplored. But the night of the 4th of November arrived\nwithout the unveiling of this submarine mystery.\n\nThe next day, the 5th of November, at twelve, the delay would (morally\nspeaking) expire; after that time, Commander Farragut, faithful to his\npromise, was to turn the course to the south-east and abandon for ever\nthe northern regions of the Pacific.\n\nThe frigate was then in 31° 15′ north latitude and 136° 42′ east\nlongitude. The coast of Japan still remained less than two hundred\nmiles to leeward. Night was approaching. They had just struck eight\nbells; large clouds veiled the face of the moon, then in its first\nquarter. The sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel.\n\nAt that moment I was leaning forward on the starboard netting. Conseil,\nstanding near me, was looking straight before him. The crew, perched in\nthe ratlines, examined the horizon, which contracted and darkened by\ndegrees. Officers with their night glasses scoured the growing\ndarkness; sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the moon,\nwhich darted between two clouds, then all trace of light was lost in\nthe darkness.\n\nIn looking at Conseil, I could see he was undergoing a little of the\ngeneral influence. At least I thought so. Perhaps for the first time\nhis nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity.\n\n“Come, Conseil,” said I, “this is the last chance of pocketing the two\nthousand dollars.”\n\n“May I be permitted to say, sir,” replied Conseil, “that I never\nreckoned on getting the prize; and, had the government of the Union\noffered a hundred thousand dollars, it would have been none the\npoorer.”\n\n“You are right, Conseil. It is a foolish affair after all, and one upon\nwhich we entered too lightly. What time lost, what useless emotions! We\nshould have been back in France six months ago.”\n\n“In your little room, sir,” replied Conseil, “and in your museum, sir,\nand I should have already classed all your fossils, sir. And the\nBabiroussa would have been installed in its cage in the Jardin des\nPlantes, and have drawn all the curious people of the capital!”\n\n“As you say, Conseil. I fancy we shall run a fair chance of being\nlaughed at for our pains.”\n\n“That’s tolerably certain,” replied Conseil, quietly; “I think they\nwill make fun of you, sir. And, must I say it?”\n\n“Go on, my good friend.”\n\n“Well, sir, you will only get your deserts.”\n\n“Indeed!”\n\n“When one has the honour of being a savant as you are, sir, one should\nnot expose one’s self to——”\n\nConseil had not time to finish his compliment. In the midst of general\nsilence a voice had just been heard. It was the voice of Ned Land\nshouting—\n\n“Look out there! The very thing we are looking for—on our weather\nbeam!”\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\nA FEW DAYS ON LAND\n\n\nI was much impressed on touching land. Ned Land tried the soil with his\nfeet, as if to take possession of it. However, it was only two months\nbefore that we had become, according to Captain Nemo, “passengers on\nboard the _Nautilus_,” but, in reality, prisoners of its commander.\n\nIn a few minutes we were within musket-shot of the coast. The whole\nhorizon was hidden behind a beautiful curtain of forests. Enormous\ntrees, the trunks of which attained a height of 200 feet, were tied to\neach other by garlands of bindweed, real natural hammocks, which a\nlight breeze rocked. They were mimosas, figs, hibisci, and palm trees,\nmingled together in profusion; and under the shelter of their verdant\nvault grew orchids, leguminous plants, and ferns.\n\nBut, without noticing all these beautiful specimens of Papuan flora,\nthe Canadian abandoned the agreeable for the useful. He discovered a\ncoco-tree, beat down some of the fruit, broke them, and we drunk the\nmilk and ate the nut with a satisfaction that protested against the\nordinary food on the _Nautilus_.\n\n“Excellent!” said Ned Land.\n\n“Exquisite!” replied Conseil.\n\n“And I do not think,” said the Canadian, “that he would object to our\nintroducing a cargo of coco-nuts on board.”\n\n“I do not think he would, but he would not taste them.”\n\n“So much the worse for him,” said Conseil.\n\n“And so much the better for us,” replied Ned Land. “There will be more\nfor us.”\n\n“One word only, Master Land,” I said to the harpooner, who was\nbeginning to ravage another coco-nut tree. “Coco-nuts are good things,\nbut before filling the canoe with them it would be wise to reconnoitre\nand see if the island does not produce some substance not less useful.\nFresh vegetables would be welcome on board the _Nautilus_.”\n\n“Master is right,” replied Conseil; “and I propose to reserve three\nplaces in our vessel, one for fruits, the other for vegetables, and the\nthird for the venison, of which I have not yet seen the smallest\nspecimen.”\n\n“Conseil, we must not despair,” said the Canadian.\n\n“Let us continue,” I returned, “and lie in wait. Although the island\nseems uninhabited, it might still contain some individuals that would\nbe less hard than we on the nature of game.”\n\n“Ho! ho!” said Ned Land, moving his jaws significantly.\n\n“Well, Ned!” said Conseil.\n\n“My word!” returned the Canadian, “I begin to understand the charms of\nanthropophagy.”\n\n“Ned! Ned! what are you saying? You, a man-eater? I should not feel\nsafe with you, especially as I share your cabin. I might perhaps wake\none day to find myself half devoured.”\n\n“Friend Conseil, I like you much, but not enough to eat you\nunnecessarily.”\n\n“I would not trust you,” replied Conseil. “But enough. We must\nabsolutely bring down some game to satisfy this cannibal, or else one\nof these fine mornings, master will find only pieces of his servant to\nserve him.”\n\nWhile we were talking thus, we were penetrating the sombre arches of\nthe forest, and for two hours we surveyed it in all directions.\n\nChance rewarded our search for eatable vegetables, and one of the most\nuseful products of the tropical zones furnished us with precious food\nthat we missed on board. I would speak of the bread-fruit tree, very\nabundant in the island of Gilboa; and I remarked chiefly the variety\ndestitute of seeds, which bears in Malaya the name of “rima.”\n\nNed Land knew these fruits well. He had already eaten many during his\nnumerous voyages, and he knew how to prepare the eatable substance.\nMoreover, the sight of them excited him, and he could contain himself\nno longer.\n\n“Master,” he said, “I shall die if I do not taste a little of this\nbread-fruit pie.”\n\n“Taste it, friend Ned—taste it as you want. We are here to make\nexperiments—make them.”\n\n“It won’t take long,” said the Canadian.\n\nAnd, provided with a lentil, he lighted a fire of dead wood that\ncrackled joyously. During this time, Conseil and I chose the best\nfruits of the bread-fruit. Some had not then attained a sufficient\ndegree of maturity; and their thick skin covered a white but rather\nfibrous pulp. Others, the greater number yellow and gelatinous, waited\nonly to be picked.\n\nThese fruits enclosed no kernel. Conseil brought a dozen to Ned Land,\nwho placed them on a coal fire, after having cut them in thick slices,\nand while doing this repeating:\n\n“You will see, master, how good this bread is. More so when one has\nbeen deprived of it so long. It is not even bread,” added he, “but a\ndelicate pastry. You have eaten none, master?”\n\n“No, Ned.”\n\n“Very well, prepare yourself for a juicy thing. If you do not come for\nmore, I am no longer the king of harpooners.”\n\nAfter some minutes, the part of the fruits that was exposed to the fire\nwas completely roasted. The interior looked like a white pasty, a sort\nof soft crumb, the flavour of which was like that of an artichoke.\n\nIt must be confessed this bread was excellent, and I ate of it with\ngreat relish.\n\n“What time is it now?” asked the Canadian.\n\n“Two o’clock at least,” replied Conseil.\n\n“How time flies on firm ground!” sighed Ned Land.\n\n“Let us be off,” replied Conseil.\n\nWe returned through the forest, and completed our collection by a raid\nupon the cabbage-palms, that we gathered from the tops of the trees,\nlittle beans that I recognised as the “abrou” of the Malays, and yams\nof a superior quality.\n\nWe were loaded when we reached the boat. But Ned Land did not find his\nprovisions sufficient. Fate, however, favoured us. Just as we were\npushing off, he perceived several trees, from twenty-five to thirty\nfeet high, a species of palm-tree.\n\nAt last, at five o’clock in the evening, loaded with our riches, we\nquitted the shore, and half an hour after we hailed the _Nautilus_. No\none appeared on our arrival. The enormous iron-plated cylinder seemed\ndeserted. The provisions embarked, I descended to my chamber, and after\nsupper slept soundly.\n\nThe next day, 6th January, nothing new on board. Not a sound inside,\nnot a sign of life. The boat rested along the edge, in the same place\nin which we had left it. We resolved to return to the island. Ned Land\nhoped to be more fortunate than on the day before with regard to the\nhunt, and wished to visit another part of the forest.\n\nAt dawn we set off. The boat, carried on by the waves that flowed to\nshore, reached the island in a few minutes.\n\nWe landed, and, thinking that it was better to give in to the Canadian,\nwe followed Ned Land, whose long limbs threatened to distance us. He\nwound up the coast towards the west: then, fording some torrents, he\ngained the high plain that was bordered with admirable forests. Some\nkingfishers were rambling along the water-courses, but they would not\nlet themselves be approached. Their circumspection proved to me that\nthese birds knew what to expect from bipeds of our species, and I\nconcluded that, if the island was not inhabited, at least human beings\noccasionally frequented it.\n\nAfter crossing a rather large prairie, we arrived at the skirts of a\nlittle wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large\nnumber of birds.\n\n“There are only birds,” said Conseil.\n\n“But they are eatable,” replied the harpooner.\n\n“I do not agree with you, friend Ned, for I see only parrots there.”\n\n“Friend Conseil,” said Ned, gravely, “the parrot is like pheasant to\nthose who have nothing else.”\n\n“And,” I added, “this bird, suitably prepared, is worth knife and\nfork.”\n\nIndeed, under the thick foliage of this wood, a world of parrots were\nflying from branch to branch, only needing a careful education to speak\nthe human language. For the moment, they were chattering with parrots\nof all colours, and grave cockatoos, who seemed to meditate upon some\nphilosophical problem, whilst brilliant red lories passed like a piece\nof bunting carried away by the breeze, papuans, with the finest azure\ncolours, and in all a variety of winged things most charming to behold,\nbut few eatable.\n\nHowever, a bird peculiar to these lands, and which has never passed the\nlimits of the Arrow and Papuan islands, was wanting in this collection.\nBut fortune reserved it for me before long.\n\nAfter passing through a moderately thick copse, we found a plain\nobstructed with bushes. I saw then those magnificent birds, the\ndisposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the\nwind. Their undulating flight, graceful aerial curves, and the shading\nof their colours, attracted and charmed one’s looks. I had no trouble\nin recognising them.\n\n“Birds of paradise!” I exclaimed.\n\nThe Malays, who carry on a great trade in these birds with the Chinese,\nhave several means that we could not employ for taking them. Sometimes\nthey put snares on the top of high trees that the birds of paradise\nprefer to frequent. Sometimes they catch them with a viscous birdlime\nthat paralyses their movements. They even go so far as to poison the\nfountains that the birds generally drink from. But we were obliged to\nfire at them during flight, which gave us few chances to bring them\ndown; and, indeed, we vainly exhausted one half our ammunition.\n\nAbout eleven o’clock in the morning, the first range of mountains that\nform the centre of the island was traversed, and we had killed nothing.\nHunger drove us on. The hunters had relied on the products of the\nchase, and they were wrong. Happily Conseil, to his great surprise,\nmade a double shot and secured breakfast. He brought down a white\npigeon and a wood-pigeon, which, cleverly plucked and suspended from a\nskewer, was roasted before a red fire of dead wood. While these\ninteresting birds were cooking, Ned prepared the fruit of the\nbread-tree. Then the wood-pigeons were devoured to the bones, and\ndeclared excellent. The nutmeg, with which they are in the habit of\nstuffing their crops, flavours their flesh and renders it delicious\neating.\n\n“Now, Ned, what do you miss now?”\n\n“Some four-footed game, M. Aronnax. All these pigeons are only\nside-dishes and trifles; and until I have killed an animal with cutlets\nI shall not be content.”\n\n“Nor I, Ned, if I do not catch a bird of paradise.”\n\n“Let us continue hunting,” replied Conseil. “Let us go towards the sea.\nWe have arrived at the first declivities of the mountains, and I think\nwe had better regain the region of forests.”\n\nThat was sensible advice, and was followed out. After walking for one\nhour we had attained a forest of sago-trees. Some inoffensive serpents\nglided away from us. The birds of paradise fled at our approach, and\ntruly I despaired of getting near one when Conseil, who was walking in\nfront, suddenly bent down, uttered a triumphal cry, and came back to me\nbringing a magnificent specimen.\n\n“Ah! bravo, Conseil!”\n\n“Master is very good.”\n\n“No, my boy; you have made an excellent stroke. Take one of these\nliving birds, and carry it in your hand.”\n\n“If master will examine it, he will see that I have not deserved great\nmerit.”\n\n“Why, Conseil?”\n\n“Because this bird is as drunk as a quail.”\n\n“Drunk!”\n\n“Yes, sir; drunk with the nutmegs that it devoured under the\nnutmeg-tree, under which I found it. See, friend Ned, see the monstrous\neffects of intemperance!”\n\n“By Jove!” exclaimed the Canadian, “because I have drunk gin for two\nmonths, you must needs reproach me!”\n\nHowever, I examined the curious bird. Conseil was right. The bird,\ndrunk with the juice, was quite powerless. It could not fly; it could\nhardly walk.\n\nThis bird belonged to the most beautiful of the eight species that are\nfound in Papua and in the neighbouring islands. It was the “large\nemerald bird, the most rare kind.” It measured three feet in length.\nIts head was comparatively small, its eyes placed near the opening of\nthe beak, and also small. But the shades of colour were beautiful,\nhaving a yellow beak, brown feet and claws, nut-coloured wings with\npurple tips, pale yellow at the back of the neck and head, and emerald\ncolour at the throat, chestnut on the breast and belly. Two horned,\ndowny nets rose from below the tail, that prolonged the long light\nfeathers of admirable fineness, and they completed the whole of this\nmarvellous bird, that the natives have poetically named the “bird of\nthe sun.”\n\nBut if my wishes were satisfied by the possession of the bird of\nparadise, the Canadian’s were not yet. Happily, about two o’clock, Ned\nLand brought down a magnificent hog; from the brood of those the\nnatives call “bari-outang.” The animal came in time for us to procure\nreal quadruped meat, and he was well received. Ned Land was very proud\nof his shot. The hog, hit by the electric ball, fell stone dead. The\nCanadian skinned and cleaned it properly, after having taken half a\ndozen cutlets, destined to furnish us with a grilled repast in the\nevening. Then the hunt was resumed, which was still more marked by Ned\nand Conseil’s exploits.\n\nIndeed, the two friends, beating the bushes, roused a herd of kangaroos\nthat fled and bounded along on their elastic paws. But these animals\ndid not take to flight so rapidly but what the electric capsule could\nstop their course.\n\n“Ah, Professor!” cried Ned Land, who was carried away by the delights\nof the chase, “what excellent game, and stewed, too! What a supply for\nthe _Nautilus!_ Two! three! five down! And to think that we shall eat\nthat flesh, and that the idiots on board shall not have a crumb!”\n\nI think that, in the excess of his joy, the Canadian, if he had not\ntalked so much, would have killed them all. But he contented himself\nwith a single dozen of these interesting marsupians. These animals were\nsmall. They were a species of those “kangaroo rabbitss” that live\nhabitually in the hollows of trees, and whose speed is extreme; but\nthey are moderately fat, and furnish, at least, estimable food. We were\nvery satisfied with the results of the hunt. Happy Ned proposed to\nreturn to this enchanting island the next day, for he wished to\ndepopulate it of all the eatable quadrupeds. But he had reckoned\nwithout his host.\n\nAt six o’clock in the evening we had regained the shore; our boat was\nmoored to the usual place. The _Nautilus_, like a long rock, emerged\nfrom the waves two miles from the beach. Ned Land, without waiting,\noccupied himself about the important dinner business. He understood all\nabout cooking well. The “bari-outang,” grilled on the coals, soon\nscented the air with a delicious odour.\n\nIndeed, the dinner was excellent. Two wood-pigeons completed this\nextraordinary menu. The sago pasty, the artocarpus bread, some mangoes,\nhalf a dozen pineapples, and the liquor fermented from some coco-nuts,\noverjoyed us. I even think that my worthy companions’ ideas had not all\nthe plainness desirable.\n\n“Suppose we do not return to the _Nautilus_ this evening?” said\nConseil.\n\n“Suppose we never return?” added Ned Land.\n\nJust then a stone fell at our feet and cut short the harpooner’s\nproposition.\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\nA WALK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA\n\n\nThis cell was, to speak correctly, the arsenal and wardrobe of the\n_Nautilus_. A dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition, waiting\nour use.\n\nNed Land, on seeing them, showed evident repugnance to dress himself in\none.\n\n“But, my worthy Ned, the forests of the Island of Crespo are nothing\nbut submarine forests.”\n\n“Good!” said the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh\nmeat fade away. “And you, M. Aronnax, are you going to dress yourself\nin those clothes?”\n\n“There is no alternative, Master Ned.”\n\n“As you please, sir,” replied the harpooner, shrugging his shoulders;\n“but as for me, unless I am forced, I will never get into one.”\n\n“No one will force you, Master Ned,” said Captain Nemo.\n\n“Is Conseil going to risk it?” asked Ned.\n\n“I follow my master wherever he goes,” replied Conseil.\n\nAt the Captain’s call two of the ship’s crew came to help us to dress\nin these heavy and impervious clothes, made of india-rubber without\nseam, and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure. One\nwould have thought it a suit of armour, both supple and resisting. This\nsuit formed trousers and waistcoat. The trousers were finished off with\nthick boots, weighted with heavy leaden soles. The texture of the\nwaistcoat was held together by bands of copper, which crossed the\nchest, protecting it from the great pressure of the water, and leaving\nthe lungs free to act; the sleeves ended in gloves, which in no way\nrestrained the movement of the hands. There was a vast difference\nnoticeable between these consummate apparatuses and the old cork\nbreastplates, jackets, and other contrivances in vogue during the\neighteenth century.\n\nCaptain Nemo and one of his companions (a sort of Hercules, who must\nhave possessed great strength), Conseil, and myself, were soon\nenveloped in the dresses. There remained nothing more to be done but to\nenclose our heads in the metal box. But before proceeding to this\noperation, I asked the Captain’s permission to examine the guns we were\nto carry.\n\nOne of the _Nautilus_ men gave me a simple gun, the butt end of which,\nmade of steel, hollow in the centre, was rather large. It served as a\nreservoir for compressed air, which a valve, worked by a spring,\nallowed to escape into a metal tube. A box of projectiles, in a groove\nin the thickness of the butt end, contained about twenty of these\nelectric balls, which, by means of a spring, were forced into the\nbarrel of the gun. As soon as one shot was fired, another was ready.\n\n“Captain Nemo,” said I, “this arm is perfect, and easily handled: I\nonly ask to be allowed to try it. But how shall we gain the bottom of\nthe sea?”\n\n“At this moment, Professor, the _Nautilus_ is stranded in five fathoms,\nand we have nothing to do but to start.”\n\n“But how shall we get off?”\n\n“You shall see.”\n\nCaptain Nemo thrust his head into the helmet, Conseil and I did the\nsame, not without hearing an ironical “Good sport!” from the Canadian.\nThe upper part of our dress terminated in a copper collar upon which\nwas screwed the metal helmet. Three holes, protected by thick glass,\nallowed us to see in all directions, by simply turning our head in the\ninterior of the head-dress. As soon as it was in position, the\nRouquayrol apparatus on our backs began to act; and, for my part, I\ncould breathe with ease.\n\nWith the Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt, and the gun in my hand, I\nwas ready to set out. But to speak the truth, imprisoned in these heavy\ngarments, and glued to the deck by my leaden soles, it was impossible\nfor me to take a step.\n\n\n[Illustration] I was ready to set out\n\n\nBut this state of things was provided for. I felt myself being pushed\ninto a little room contiguous to the wardrobe-room. My companions\nfollowed, towed along in the same way. I heard a water-tight door,\nfurnished with stopper-plates, close upon us, and we were wrapped in\nprofound darkness.\n\nAfter some minutes, a loud hissing was heard. I felt the cold mount\nfrom my feet to my chest. Evidently from some part of the vessel they\nhad, by means of a tap, given entrance to the water, which was invading\nus, and with which the room was soon filled. A second door cut in the\nside of the _Nautilus_ then opened. We saw a faint light. In another\ninstant our feet trod the bottom of the sea.\n\nAnd now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walk\nunder the waters? Words are impotent to relate such wonders! Captain\nNemo walked in front, his companion followed some steps behind. Conseil\nand I remained near each other, as if an exchange of words had been\npossible through our metallic cases. I no longer felt the weight of my\nclothing, or of my shoes, of my reservoir of air, or my thick helmet,\nin the midst of which my head rattled like an almond in its shell.\n\nThe light, which lit the soil thirty feet below the surface of the\nocean, astonished me by its power. The solar rays shone through the\nwatery mass easily, and dissipated all colour, and I clearly\ndistinguished objects at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards.\nBeyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine, and\nfaded into vague obscurity. Truly this water which surrounded me was\nbut another air denser than the terrestrial atmosphere, but almost as\ntransparent. Above me was the calm surface of the sea.\n\nWe were walking on fine, even sand, not wrinkled, as on a flat shore,\nwhich retains the impression of the billows. This dazzling carpet,\nreally a reflector, repelled the rays of the sun with wonderful\nintensity, which accounted for the vibration which penetrated every\natom of liquid. Shall I be believed when I say that, at the depth of\nthirty feet, I could see as if I was in broad daylight?\n\nFor a quarter of an hour I trod on this sand, sown with the impalpable\ndust of shells. The hull of the _Nautilus_, resembling a long shoal,\ndisappeared by degrees; but its lantern, when darkness should overtake\nus in the waters, would help to guide us on board by its distinct rays.\n\nSoon forms of objects outlined in the distance were discernible. I\nrecognised magnificent rocks, hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the\nmost beautiful kind, and I was at first struck by the peculiar effect\nof this medium.\n\nIt was then ten in the morning; the rays of the sun struck the surface\nof the waves at rather an oblique angle, and at the touch of their\nlight, decomposed by refraction as through a prism, flowers, rocks,\nplants, shells, and polypi were shaded at the edges by the seven solar\ncolours. It was marvellous, a feast for the eyes, this complication of\ncoloured tints, a perfect kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange,\nviolet, indigo, and blue; in one word, the whole palette of an\nenthusiastic colourist! Why could I not communicate to Conseil the\nlively sensations which were mounting to my brain, and rival him in\nexpressions of admiration? For aught I knew, Captain Nemo and his\ncompanion might be able to exchange thoughts by means of signs\npreviously agreed upon. So, for want of better, I talked to myself; I\ndeclaimed in the copper box which covered my head, thereby expending\nmore air in vain words than was perhaps expedient.\n\nVarious kinds of isis, clusters of pure tuft-coral, prickly fungi, and\nanemones formed a brilliant garden of flowers, enamelled with porphitæ,\ndecked with their collarettes of blue tentacles, sea-stars studding the\nsandy bottom, together with asterophytons like fine lace embroidered by\nthe hands of naïads, whose festoons were waved by the gentle\nundulations caused by our walk. It was a real grief to me to crush\nunder my feet the brilliant specimens of molluscs which strewed the\nground by thousands, of hammer-heads, donaciae (veritable bounding\nshells), of staircases, and red helmet-shells, angel-wings, and many\nothers produced by this inexhaustible ocean. But we were bound to walk,\nso we went on, whilst above our heads waved shoals of physalides\nleaving their tentacles to float in their train, medusæ whose umbrellas\nof opal or rose-pink, escalloped with a band of blue, sheltered us from\nthe rays of the sun and fiery pelagiæ, which, in the darkness, would\nhave strewn our path with phosphorescent light.\n\nAll these wonders I saw in the space of a quarter of a mile, scarcely\nstopping, and following Captain Nemo, who beckoned me on by signs. Soon\nthe nature of the soil changed; to the sandy plain succeeded an extent\nof slimy mud, which the Americans call “ooze,” composed of equal parts\nof silicious and calcareous shells. We then travelled over a plain of\nsea-weed of wild and luxuriant vegetation. This sward was of close\ntexture, and soft to the feet, and rivalled the softest carpet woven by\nthe hand of man. But whilst verdure was spread at our feet, it did not\nabandon our heads. A light network of marine plants, of that\ninexhaustible family of sea-weeds of which more than two thousand kinds\nare known, grew on the surface of the water. I saw long ribbons of\nfucus floating, some globular, others tuberous; laurenciæ and\ncladostephi of most delicate foliage, and some rhodomeniæ palmatæ,\nresembling the fan of a cactus. I noticed that the green plants kept\nnearer the top of the sea, whilst the red were at a greater depth,\nleaving to the black or brown hydrophytes the care of forming gardens\nand parterres in the remote beds of the ocean.\n\nWe had quitted the _Nautilus_ about an hour and a half. It was near\nnoon; I knew by the perpendicularity of the sun’s rays, which were no\nlonger refracted. The magical colours disappeared by degrees, and the\nshades of emerald and sapphire were effaced. We walked with a regular\nstep, which rang upon the ground with astonishing intensity; the\nslightest noise was transmitted with a quickness to which the ear is\nunaccustomed on the earth; indeed, water is a better conductor of sound\nthan air, in the ratio of four to one. At this period the earth sloped\ndownwards; the light took a uniform tint. We were at a depth of a\nhundred and five yards and twenty inches, undergoing a pressure of six\natmospheres.\n\nAt this depth I could still see the rays of the sun, though feebly; to\ntheir intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight, the lowest\nstate between day and night; but we could still see well enough; it was\nnot necessary to resort to the Ruhmkorff apparatus as yet. At this\nmoment Captain Nemo stopped; he waited till I joined him, and then\npointed to an obscure mass, looming in the shadow, at a short distance.\n\n“It is the forest of the Island of Crespo,” thought I;—and I was not\nmistaken.\n","seen_by":[{"annotator":"louis.gauthy@gmail.com","annotator_id":1}],"comments":[],"metadata":{},"example_id":"c5d0ab82-5b61-44e6-b386-c2f548c10f0a","annotations":[{"end":13910,"tag":"PERSON","start":13902,"value":"Ned
