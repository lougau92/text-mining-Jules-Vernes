The rest of the notebooks can be run locally. "text and entity extraction" is the implementation of the named entity extraction using NLTK and Regular expression. Those extracted are visualised in "entity visualisations.ipynb", and evaluated in "entity\_evaluation.ipynb". Relations between them are build and visualised in "relation\_extraction". Finally, "topic\_modeling.ipynb" provides the implementation for the NMF topic modeling and evaluation. All the figures of this report are included in the "plots" folder and all the data used are included in the "data" folder.
